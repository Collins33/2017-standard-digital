Authors received a boost after more than 50,000 copies of pirated books believed to be worth Sh15 million were destroyed. The exercise was presided over by Kenya Copyright Board&#39;s Executive Director Edward Sigei who was joined by representatives of publishers and authors at the weekend. Local authors such as Pauline Keya, Adipo Sigang and novelist Tony Mochama attended the event at Kamongo Waste Paper Ltd in Nairobi&#39;s Industrial area. The books destroyed were predominantly set books such as&nbsp;Mstahiki Meya, Kidagaa&nbsp; Kimemwozea and Damu Nyeusi. Others were fast-selling titles under the High-Flyer series. They were confiscated in 2015 from two suspects at a printing press. Mr Sigei has vowed to go on with the exercise.
