The&nbsp;first&nbsp;time&nbsp;she&nbsp;hit&nbsp;the&nbsp;headlines&nbsp;in a&nbsp;notorious&nbsp;manner&nbsp;was&nbsp;when&nbsp;news&nbsp;filtered&nbsp;one&nbsp;morning&nbsp;five&nbsp;years&nbsp;ago&nbsp;that an&nbsp;assistantminister&nbsp;had&nbsp;beaten&nbsp;up&nbsp;her&nbsp;husband. To the rest of the country, this was just the salacious gossip of the powerful and mighty going through the shame of domestic violence. But to Elizabeth Ongoro and&nbsp;her&nbsp;husband&nbsp;Ferdinand Masha, it was an unwelcome intrusion into their privacy; a lie concocted by outsiders and spread by a willing media keen to serve a great story to a ready public. At the&nbsp;time, Ongoro was eight months pregnant. Such&nbsp;news&nbsp;sent&nbsp;her&nbsp;into shock.&nbsp;She&nbsp;became sick. &ldquo;I almost lost the baby because of the shock. I went through so much trauma, I almost resigned from my seat,&rdquo;&nbsp;she&nbsp;recalled in the TV interview reviewed by The Sunday Standard. &ldquo;For somebody to accuse you, a woman who is eight months pregnant, of battering a very physically fit man, it was so hilarious.&rdquo; Questions were raised&nbsp;when&nbsp;she&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t seen at the hospital to pick&nbsp;up&nbsp;her&nbsp;husband, but&nbsp;she&nbsp;was very pregnant and sick, and&nbsp;she&nbsp;actually confirms that&nbsp;she&nbsp;&ldquo;really cried&rdquo; and was &ldquo;really depressed&rdquo; and that is why&nbsp;she&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t appear in public to explain herself. But&nbsp;she&nbsp;picked herself&nbsp;up, and as the clock ticked towards March 2013,&nbsp;she&nbsp;dreamt big and sought to be elected the next senator for Nairobi.&nbsp;She&nbsp;launched&nbsp;her&nbsp;campaign and was the front-runner for that seat within ODM, until questions arose about the academic papers for Margaret Wanjiru who&nbsp;had&nbsp;sought to vie for the gubernatorial seat.

Bett explained that with Dr Evans Kidero having been given the gubernatorial ticket, there&nbsp;had&nbsp;to be another person (read a non-Luo) in the line-up, and Wanjiru, a Kikuyu, was ODM&rsquo;s choice to balance the candidates in the city. Catfight &ldquo;Did I have any problems? My certificate was given to Margaret, I didn&rsquo;t go after&nbsp;her; I didn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo;&nbsp;she&nbsp;said. They offered&nbsp;her&nbsp;the Ruaraka parliamentary seat, although the nomination certificate&nbsp;had&nbsp;already been given to&nbsp; city lawyer Tom TJ Kajwang&rsquo;. Ongoro rejected the certificate. &ldquo;I do not believe that because my seat was taken, I should take another person&rsquo;s seat,&rdquo;&nbsp;she&nbsp;explained at a&nbsp;news&nbsp;conference. After the polls,&nbsp;she&nbsp;was nominated to the Senate. At a party retreat in 2013, held at a luxurious tourist hotel in the resort town of Naivasha,&nbsp;she&nbsp;offers to run for the position of Deputy Minority Leader. But then,&nbsp;she&nbsp;was prevailed upon to surrender the seat, and give it to someone from Northern Kenya. But at that Naivasha meeting,&nbsp;her&nbsp;stubborn streak&nbsp; got&nbsp;her&nbsp;into trouble.

The two women in question were Elizabeth Ongoro and Janet Ong&rsquo;era. Before that meeting and the cat fight, Ongoro was better known for&nbsp;her&nbsp;role as&nbsp;assistant&nbsp;minister&nbsp;for Nairobi Metropolitan Development, while Ong&rsquo;era&nbsp;had&nbsp;just served as the Executive Director of the Orange Democratic Movement. If you ask Ongoro about what happened,&nbsp;she&rsquo;d tell you that it wasn&rsquo;t a fight exactly, but that Ong&rsquo;era attacked&nbsp;her. Reason?&nbsp;She&nbsp;told Ong&rsquo;era that as ODM&rsquo;s Executive Director,&nbsp;she&nbsp;mismanaged the nominations and cost ODM the presidency. Unshaken &ldquo;Sometimes it hurts&nbsp;when&nbsp;people are confronted with the bitter truth, and sometimes people don&rsquo;t know how to deal with the truth, so for&nbsp;her, it was a violent reaction and that is what it was,&rdquo; Ongoro said. &ldquo;The buck stops with somebody and that is the executive director&rdquo;. She&nbsp;went on: &ldquo;Why would&nbsp;she&nbsp;(Ong&rsquo;era) put&nbsp;her&nbsp;name as number&nbsp;one&nbsp;in the (party) list (for nomination slots).&nbsp;She&nbsp;has to go for ODM to move ahead. If that drew anger and a violent reaction from&nbsp;her, it really doesn&rsquo;t shake me. I still stand my ground that&nbsp;she&nbsp;has to quit. I still stand my ground that&nbsp;she&nbsp;has cost us the elections. It is not something I am gossiping about, or something I am talking about in secret&rdquo;. Ongoro denied that they fought.&nbsp;She&nbsp;was assaulted,&nbsp;she&nbsp;said, and vowed to file charges.

I mean people fight mental wars, not physical, at least not in this age and era.&rdquo;&nbsp; But that ended, and&nbsp;she&nbsp;served in the Senate, occasionally popping&nbsp;up&nbsp;in Mombasa after&nbsp;she&nbsp;ousted Wavinya Ndeti from the leadership of Political Parties Liaison Committee in elections that were declared a sham. Or that day in church&nbsp;when&nbsp;she&nbsp;told off the then Party of Action boss Raphael Tuju for failing to use his&nbsp;time&nbsp;in Cabinet to influence policies. Tuju is now the head of the Jubilee secretariat. &ldquo;(You were) a Cabinet&nbsp;minister&nbsp;and an MP... there&rsquo;s really no need coming to cheat wananchi that you now symptahise with them&nbsp;when&nbsp;you never influenced the se issues during your&nbsp;time&nbsp;in Cabinet,&rdquo; Ongoro said. Not budging Now&nbsp;she&nbsp;is back in the limelight, because, again, even&nbsp;her&nbsp;attempt to go for the Ruaraka seat has been thwarted. &ldquo;When&nbsp;I was vying for the Senate, they said regional balancing, I go for a parliamentary seat, they give direct tickets. I am not budging, I am not bowing out of the race. I am not being cowed, no more intimidation. Enough is enough, everything that has a beginning must have an end. I have taken enough nonsense so far,&rdquo; Ongoro said this week&nbsp;when&nbsp;she&nbsp;stormed Orange House, ODM&rsquo;s headquarters. She&nbsp;made allegations of bribery against the NEB chair Judith Pareno and the Executive Director Oduor Ong&rsquo;wen. They say, third&nbsp;time&nbsp;is a charm. Will Ongoro be lucky?
