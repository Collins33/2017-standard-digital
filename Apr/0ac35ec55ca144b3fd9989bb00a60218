&nbsp; JP Secretary General Raphael Tuju Jubilee Party aspirants have warned the party&rsquo;s election board against recruiting additional presiding officers and clerks being fronted by sitting legislators. According to some of the aspirants, Japter Rono, who was appointed by the party as the County Returning Officer, erred in allowing &lsquo;strangers&rsquo; to attend a training session for presiding officers and clerks at the Nakuru Show Ground. &ldquo;The move by Mr Rono to allow strangers to the meeting of election officials appointed by the party is suspicious. Most of them were people fronted by incumbent MPs,&rdquo; claimed Benson Mwangi, an aspiring parliamentary aspirant. The protest by the aspirants comes days after JP Secretary General Raphael Tuju was forced to intervene following claims that four current MPs, gubernatorial and senatorial aspirants (two hopefuls) had plotted to infiltrate the Jubilee County Elections Board.

Yesterday, Mr Sitienei and Mr Rono said they have adhered to the provisional list of presiding officers and clerks provided by the party secretariat but would make additions where necessary for the sake of efficiency during the voting day. &ldquo;We are analysing the 900 polling centres that have been approved to make the voting process fast and efficient, we need additional streams at the polling centres. That will require more presiding officers and clerks,&rdquo; Mr Rono said, adding that he was still consulting.
