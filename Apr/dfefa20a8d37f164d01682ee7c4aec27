Medical reports of Jimmy Baburam &mdash; a tycoon who drowned in a swimming pool under unclear circumstances last year &mdash; show he had used hard drugs and had a history of ill health. The report from Karen Hospital and Netcare Sunninghill Hospital in South Africa which was produced by the defence indicates Jimmy had a history of alcohol and cocaine abuse. Jimmy&rsquo;s widow Amina Shiraz has been charged with his murder, a charge she denies. The medical report was presented before Justice Dorah Chepkwony by Senior Counsel Ahmednassir Abdullahi representing Amina.&nbsp; David Baburam, the deceased&rsquo;s father who testified&nbsp;at the Mombasa High Court, was pressed hard by the defence which sought to prove Jimmy drowned after a seizure caused by alcohol intoxication. Abdullahi described late Jimmy as a drug drug addict who abused cocaine. Vast wealth David denied knowledge of his son&rsquo;s drug addiction but admitted the late Jimmy often suffered seizures prompting his admission to Karen Hospital and a South African hospital. David admitted that his son&rsquo;s marriage was turbulent and that he had once fired gunshots to his wife. The defence says Amina has been framed because of the vast wealth at stake. According to the State, Jimmy was murdered by his wife while on a family vacation in Malindi. But the defence insists the businessman drowned during a seizure after taking alcohol. The prosecution has applied for the extradition of one Jacob Schmalze who was allegedly with him at the same hotel when the death occurred. Amina was arrested and charged on October 12 2016. But Schmalze is still at large. Shiraz denied the charges and was released on a Sh10 million bond with two similar sureties.&nbsp;
