Wundanyi MP Thomas Mwadeghu was poised to clinch the ODM ticket to contest the governor&#39;s seat. Mwadeghu seemed to have secured the concession from the party on a day of high drama at Orange House where he and his rival, Governor John Mruttu, had gone to present their respective cases.&nbsp; Asked whether Mwadeghu had been handed the ticket, ODM director of communication Philip Etale replied: &quot;No&quot;, but added, &quot;he will be issued.&quot; ODM picked Mwadeghu, the National Assembly minority whip, as part of a three-man team to investigate contested results for Homa Bay and Migori governor races, which seemed to cement Etale&#39;s position.&nbsp; Mwadeghu and Mruttu moved to Orange House to seek a solution to the stalemate. Their supporters camped outside Orange House where they shouted each other down, each side claiming its candidate won the recent nominations.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Opinion: NASA stands for confusion Provisional results had shown Mwadeghu with 17,567 votes against Mruttu&#39;s 14,817. ODM ordered a repeat of voting in two wards, a move that was welcomed by Mruttu but contested by Mwadeghu. Mruttu claims there was no voting in the two stations. &quot;Basically, there are some polling stations where voting never took place. The voters are aware no voting took place in Chala,&quot; Mruttu said.&nbsp; &nbsp;
