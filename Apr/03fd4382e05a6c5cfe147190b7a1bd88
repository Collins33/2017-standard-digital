Senator Elizabeth Ongoro officially defects from ODM party after MP Tom Kajwang&rsquo; was handed direct nomination. Ongoro&nbsp;says she will still vie for Ruaraka parliamentary seat under NASA ticket.&nbsp; Senator Ongoro cited frustration from the party a day after 400 aspirants were handed direct tickets to contest in the August General Election. She was barred from contesting for Ruaraka parliamentary seat in an apparent disciplinary action after her supporters fought with those of area MP TJ Kajwang in Mathare last month. Two people lost their lives in the incident. Ongoro is yet to announce the party she has decamped to.&nbsp;
