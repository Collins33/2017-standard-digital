Nairobi residents will have to brace themselves for two days without water. The taps will run dry Thursday and Friday over maintenance, which means those without enough water in their tanks will have to look for an alternative way of flushing their toilets, bathing, washing clothes and cooking. Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company announced that there would be a total shut down of the supply lines in the city and its environs, to allow for the repair of the Matara- Ngethu line which is the main supply channel to Nairobi. NWSC head of corporate affairs, Mbaruku Vyakweli Wednesday&nbsp;confirmed the scheduled water supply interruption saying that the entire city would be affected. Short repairs &ldquo;We have reinforced the work force that is to carry out the repairs so the shortage will take less time and water supply will resume by Friday,&rdquo; said Vyakweli. He said that the Matara-Ngethu line from Ndakaini dam&nbsp;was experiencing serious leakages which compromised the amount of water getting to the city. &ldquo;The tunnel is experiencing serious leakages either by design or by default and the pressure is low which means water is not getting to intended locations,&rdquo; he said.
