MOMBASA:Nyali&nbsp;MP&nbsp;Hezron&nbsp;Awiti&nbsp;Tuesday&nbsp;accused&nbsp;Wiper&nbsp;Democratic&nbsp;Movement&nbsp;leader&nbsp;Kalonzo&nbsp;Musyoka&nbsp;of&nbsp;shielding&nbsp;Senator&nbsp;Hassan Omar&nbsp;from&nbsp;competitive&nbsp;governorship&nbsp;nominations. Mr&nbsp;Awiti&nbsp;has ditched&nbsp;Wiper&nbsp;party for Vibrant&nbsp;Democratic&nbsp;Party (VDP), where he was welcomed as the party&nbsp;leader. The&nbsp;MP&nbsp;said he loved his former party and blamed&nbsp;Kalonzo&nbsp;for his departure,&nbsp;accusing&nbsp;him of frustrating his effort to capture the&nbsp;Wiper&nbsp;ticket. &ldquo;It was two months of lengthy consultative meetings presided over by the&nbsp;Wiper&nbsp;leader. It was a cat-and-mouse game in which at one point, I was promised the&nbsp;governorship&nbsp;ticket as&nbsp;Omar&nbsp;defends his seat. But my celebration was short-lived when the story changed. I was subjected to frustration at the hands of the&nbsp;Wiper party&nbsp;leader,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Awiti. He claimed that at one point, it was agreed that 100 delegates&nbsp;from&nbsp;each of the six constituencies would come together to&nbsp;nominate&nbsp;the candidate for the governor&rsquo;s seat, but this failed. Later, he said, three representatives&nbsp;from&nbsp;the constituencies were called to make a decision, but results of these meetings were never made public. Awiti&nbsp;was addressing supporters of his new party at Wild Waters Centre&nbsp;Tuesday. He was welcomed by chairman Paul Ngei and deputy party&nbsp;leader&nbsp;Steve Ruwa among other officials.

The&nbsp;MP&nbsp;said he would unite the various communities in the county through consultative meetings and pledged to fight drug trafficking.
