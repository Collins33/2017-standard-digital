The Bomet East parliamentary race may be a family contest after Kevin Kipngetich Kalya, son of the late Minister Kipkalya Kones, clinched the Chama Cha Mashinani ticket. &nbsp;Kipngetich garnered 10,839 votes against his closest rival David Kipkononden who garnered 4,946 votes and Janet Chepkirui&#39;s 1,726 votes. &nbsp;Kipngetich&#39;s mother, Beatrice Kones, is also running for the same seat and is seeking the JP nomination. Mrs Kones is the front runner in the race and is facing off with incumbent Bernard Bett alongside Bernard Ngeno Majaliwa. &nbsp;&quot;My focus is now on the General Election and I thank the people for voting me,&quot; Kipngetich said after being declared the winner.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Tribunal orders ODM to reconstitute board
