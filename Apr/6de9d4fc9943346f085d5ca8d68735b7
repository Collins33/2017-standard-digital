Childbirth is notoriously painful and can be extremely dangerous. &nbsp;As to why this is the case for humans compared to other mammals is still widely debated and researched. As for IF there&#39;s a particularly dangerous time for mum and baby, this may have been answered. Pregnant woman There have been numerous studies into this subject and a range of results, but now scientists at the University of Texas at Austin have come up with a new theory. They claim the number of hours an obstetrician has been at work prior to an unscheduled delivery is what significantly influences risks to both mum and baby. When a doctor enters the ninth hour of a 12 hour shift, the researchers found, there is an increased risk of a mum losing a dangerous amount of blood or a newborn suffering low oxygen levels.

The team behind the research identified how fatigue will contribute to a doctor missing small foetal distress signals. These can be detected if a doctor is alert and less tired.
