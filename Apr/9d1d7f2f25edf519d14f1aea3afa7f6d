Voting has temporarily been stopped at Nyamira polling station leaving voters confused on whether to use the IEBC or ODM party register. The confusion has affected several other polling stations in the county. Delays were also reported in Taita Taveta where the party nominations did not kick off at 6am as planned due to delayed delivery of polling materials. In Nyamira, the current Governor John Nyagarama&#39;s supporters want the use of the ODM register while his opponents Dr John Kumenda and West Mugirango MP Dr James Gesami prefer the use of the IEBC register. Several polling stations have been combined, with long queues already being experienced at the Nyamira polling station. Nyairanda, Nyamira Primary, Nyangoso and Bundi polling stations in Township Ward have been combined.

Florence Kebuba, the Returning Officer at Nyamira polling station says the party list presented to them is not legible. &quot;We are struggling to read the names. We have tried in vain to counter check with the IEBC register,&quot; says Ms Kebuba. The rooms are poorly lit with polling clerks being forced to use spotlights. Governor Nyagarama will cast his ballot at Nyamotureko Primary while Dr Kumenda and Dr Gesami will vote at Keroka Farmers and Ikurucha Primary School respectively. Dr Gesami has received support from other ODM leaders in the area including North Mugirango MP Charles Geni and County MP Alice Chae. The two got their direct nominations last month. The party will also conduct parliamentary nominations in West Mugirango Constituency where four aspirants Denis Anyoka, Polycarp Orero, Dr Ombogo and Julius Matwere are battling for the ticket.
