Residents of Nyando, Kisumu County are counting their losses after flashfloods caused massive damage to property. At least 300 families were affected in parts of Nyando and Muhoroni Sub Counties. By Friday, no national or county government official had visited the area. County Commissioner Maalim Mohammed said he had instructed area deputy county commissioner to assess the situation. He said victims of the floods would get help from the disaster funds allocated by the national government. &ldquo;As we speak the Deputy County Commissioner is in a meeting with the Sub County Administrator to look into the matter,&rdquo; said Maalim. The situation was made worse after the neighbouring Kowala Primary School, which is often used as a rescue centre, was also flooded.
