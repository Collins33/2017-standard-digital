NAIROBI: Inspector&nbsp;General&nbsp;of&nbsp;Police&nbsp;Joseph&nbsp;Boinnet&nbsp;has&nbsp;30&nbsp;days&nbsp;to&nbsp;lodge&nbsp;an&nbsp;inquiry&nbsp;into the&nbsp;shooting&nbsp;of a&nbsp;woman&nbsp;at a&nbsp;police&nbsp;station&nbsp;in&nbsp;Nairobi. Anne Mwende, who&nbsp;has&nbsp;been living with a bullet&nbsp;lodged&nbsp;in her spinal cord, was allegedly shot in October 2006 by a&nbsp;police&nbsp;officer when she went to report the loss of her identity card. The court heard that since then, she&nbsp;has&nbsp;made efforts to have the matter investigated by the relevant authorities in vain. High Court judge George Odunga Friday told&nbsp;Boinnet&nbsp;and Attorney&nbsp;General&nbsp;Githu Muigai that it was irrational and unlawful to claim that an&nbsp;inquiry&nbsp;was time-barred because Mwende did not file a suit of compensation within the statutory period of three years. The court also pointed out that the Occurrence Book (OB) was not in Mwende&rsquo;s custody to enable her record the incident, adding that the respondents should have acted based on her letters. &ldquo;In this case, the respondents are expected to expeditiously deal with complaints made against the&nbsp;police. To take more than 10 years before addressing a complaint and then rely on such lapse of time to decline to carry out a statutory duty in my view is irrational and unlawful,&rdquo; the judge ruled. In the case that was filed by Kituo Cha Sheria on behalf of Mwende, she says she arrived at&nbsp;Nairobi&rsquo;s&nbsp;Reuben&nbsp;Police&nbsp;Post on October 23, 2006 at 5pm and was shot by&nbsp;police&nbsp;Constable Benard Kilemba. She was taken to Kenyatta National Hospital where doctors discovered, after three&nbsp;days, that the bullet was&nbsp;lodged&nbsp;in her back close to the spine and could not be removed surgically. The&nbsp;shooting&nbsp;officer allegedly entered into an agreement with Mwende&rsquo;s parents and accepted liability. The matter was reported at Industrial Area&nbsp;Police&nbsp;Station&nbsp;where she was issued with a P3 form. The respondents now say it would be impossible and impractical to trace witnesses present during the&nbsp;shooting.&nbsp;
