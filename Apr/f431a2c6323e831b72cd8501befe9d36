Night movement has been restricted to facilitate police operations to weed out bandits along the border of West Pokot and Marakwet counties. Marakwet East sub-county commissioner Erick Wamulevu, while issuing the order, said bandits had forced hundreds of families to flee their homes. Peace meeting Speaking at Kaisapul village during a peace meeting at the border of the two counties, Mr Wamulevu said police, together with National Police Reservists, would conduct an operation in Embobut forest where criminals are hiding. &ldquo;The criminals will be found, whether dead or alive, because they possess illegal firearms. We will not spare any bandit in the operation,&rdquo; he said, asking women to remain at home during night hours. He said chiefs who work along the border would also be armed so that they can help the police reservists pursue the criminals.
