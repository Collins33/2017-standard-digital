Mombasa Governor Hassan Ali Joho Thursday told the High Court that the forgery investigation facing him was all political witch-hunt. The governor said President Uhuru Kenyatta was behind his woes so as to bar him from contesting the August 8 polls. Through his lawyer, Senator James Orengo, Joho told the court that his tribulations at the hands of State agencies emanated from Uhuru&#39;s mid-March statement in Mtongwe when the President threatened to teach him a lesson. &quot;The utterances by Kenyatta directed to Joho, in March cannot be taken lightly, because the number of cases popping up from KRA, Kenya National Examinations Council, DPP and AG are all meant to find a basis to stop Joho from running for governorship,&quot; said Mr Orengo. The High Court last week extended orders suspending the investigation on the governor and barring police from arresting Joho. Justice Eric Ogola extended the orders to April 26 when he will give a ruling. ALSO READ: Humour as Kenyattas gather for kin's burial
