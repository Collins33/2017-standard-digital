Police in Litein were forced to lob teargas at protesters in Bureti constituency who were demonstrating over disputed poll results. Trouble began after the returning officer declared Francis Terer as Cheboin ward Jubilee Party flag bearer at St Kizito tallying centre. The other aspirants dismissed the results, forcing the returning officer to rescind the decision and declare Evans Ngeno winner. Protests were also witnessed in Chemosot ward after incumbent MCA Phillip Koskei and his archrival William Soi both claimed victory.&nbsp;
