Thursday&#39;s start to political party nominations ahead of the August 8 General Election was chaotic. All along, there have been pointers to this, something that has seen this newspaper call on political parties to put a tight leash on their aspirants and followers. First in line to conduct party primaries after the window opened Thursday was the Orange Democratic Movement, with the biggest focus on the Busia County gubernatorial race. Incumbent Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong was being challenged for the chance to vie on the ODM&#39;s ticket by Funyula MP Paul Otuoma. No one has had a kind word for the other and the possibility of violence was high. Unorthodox means like circulating fake publications purporting that Otuoma had defected to the Jubilee Party only point to desperation by a group of people who do not believe in fair competition, yet that is what elections should ideally be about. Indeed, the polls in Busia were delayed due to some technicalities, only heightening tension. Such occurrences make nonsense of our claims to have attained maturity in our observance of democracy. They are a slap in the face to our much-touted progressive constitution since leaders who should defend it deviate from it in pursuit of selfish interests. In Machakos and other stations, there was tension that shouldn&#39;t have been there in the first place. Such scenes must be avoided as other parties prepare to begin their nominations. The tough action taken by ODM&#39;s disciplinary organ against nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro who was not only barred from contesting the Ruaraka parliamentary seat but fined Sh1 million, and Governor Okoth Obado who was fined Sh2 million for misconduct are the way to go. Aspirants and their supporters must know they cannot get away with breaking the law and creating disturbance.&nbsp; ALSO READ: High stakes as political parties start picking candidates
