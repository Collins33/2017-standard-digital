NAIROBI: The&nbsp;political&nbsp;undercurrents&nbsp;being&nbsp;experienced&nbsp;in&nbsp;both&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;Party&nbsp;and the&nbsp;National&nbsp;Super&nbsp;Alliance&nbsp;(NASA)&nbsp;ahead&nbsp;of the&nbsp;August&nbsp;elections&nbsp;are&nbsp;linked&nbsp;to&nbsp;succession&nbsp;of&nbsp;President&nbsp;Uhuru&nbsp;Kenyatta and&nbsp;ODM&nbsp;leader&nbsp;Raila&nbsp;Odinga,&nbsp;analysts&nbsp;argue. The delay by&nbsp;NASA&nbsp;to name its presidential candidate, their disagreement on joint nominations, the entry of Kanu Chairman Gideon Moi in JP&nbsp;politics&nbsp;and fights over Mombasa and Nairobi governor positions on&nbsp;both&nbsp;sides of the divide are parts of the&nbsp;succession&nbsp;politics. According to Prof Rocha Chimera of Pwani University, the&nbsp;politics&nbsp;on who will inherit&nbsp;President&nbsp;Kenyatta&rsquo;s&nbsp;Mt Kenya voting bloc when his term expires in 2022 and possibility of&nbsp;Raila&nbsp;serving one term if he wins the&nbsp;presidency&nbsp;or retiring from&nbsp;politics&nbsp;if he loses, will shape&nbsp;political&nbsp;events during this year&rsquo;s General&nbsp;Election. &ldquo;Deputy&nbsp;President&nbsp;William Ruto is supporting&nbsp;President&nbsp;Kenyatta&rsquo;s&nbsp;re-election&nbsp;because he expects his voting bloc to support him in 2022 and in&nbsp;NASA, Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi anticipate to inherit&nbsp;Raila&rsquo;s&nbsp;political&nbsp;constituency,&rdquo; says Prof Chimera. He says politicians in JP and&nbsp;NASA&nbsp;with an eye on the&nbsp;presidency&nbsp;want to ensure the&nbsp;political&nbsp;decisions they make now will guarantee them&nbsp;success&nbsp;in 2022, hence the ensuing dog-fights. Prof Amukowa Anangwe of Dodoma University says while some politicians may be focusing on a post-Uhuru&nbsp;political&nbsp;dispensation, their plans are likely to flop due to changing&nbsp;political&nbsp;dynamics. &ldquo;Kenyan electoral&nbsp;politics&nbsp;is dynamic, and five years down the road may be difficult to accurately predict how things will shape up,&rdquo; says Anangwe.

In any case, they should also remain open-minded about the future twists and turns of&nbsp;succession&nbsp;politics, and take cognizance of the fact that other potential candidates in their own&nbsp;parties&nbsp;may also emerge to challenge them,&rdquo; he says. Prof Anangwe says the&nbsp;President&nbsp;may use his impending&nbsp;succession&nbsp;to lure Opposition politicians to his side because defections are the hallmark of Kenyan electoral&nbsp;politics. &ldquo;This could be a game changer in his re-election&nbsp;bid, especially if it occasions the demise of&nbsp;NASA,&rdquo; he concludes. However, according to Prof Jonah Kindiki of Moi University, the current&nbsp;political&nbsp;re-alignments are only viable between now and&nbsp;August&nbsp;8 polls. &ldquo;I am seeing a major&nbsp;political&nbsp;shake-up after the&nbsp;August&nbsp;General&nbsp;Election&nbsp;depending on who wins the&nbsp;presidency, as new&nbsp;political&nbsp;blocs are going to revolve around&nbsp;NASA&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;politicaldivides,&rdquo; says Kindiki. Political&nbsp;formations He says Rift Valley will play a key role in 2022 presidential race&nbsp;political&nbsp;formations as whoever will be interested in the&nbsp;presidency&nbsp;will have to court the electorate from the region. ALSO READ: Kalonzo: Coordinating committee cannot choose NASA flagbearer &ldquo;If&nbsp;Uhuru&nbsp;wins the&nbsp;presidency, I do not see Peter Kenneth making an impact in 2022 because it will be very hard to sell a candidate from Central Kenya after the Kibaki and&nbsp;Uhuru&nbsp;presidency. But he will likely be a key player in the emerging&nbsp;political&nbsp;re-alignments,&rdquo; he says. Prof Kindiki adds that the 2022 presidential race will coalesce around&nbsp;Jubilee-NASA&nbsp;political&nbsp;formations, with presidential aspirants from Rift Valley, Western and Lower Eastern leading the way. A lecturer at Kabianga University, Mr Herbert Kerre, says the misplaced contention in&nbsp;NASA&nbsp;over who is to be the flag-bearer is uncalled for as by leaving the&nbsp;alliance, Kalonzo would be committing&nbsp;political&nbsp;suicide. &ldquo;Mr Kalonzo is a rehabilitated politician after his 2007 miscalculations that left him with the watermelon tag. He will most likely rip a lot of&nbsp;political&nbsp;goodwill by sticking with&nbsp;NASA&nbsp;than moving out,&rdquo; he says. Mr Kerre says the entry of Kenneth and Moi in&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;politics&nbsp;has intensified the silent power struggles going on in&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;as they are&nbsp;being&nbsp;viewed with suspicion by DP Ruto. &ldquo;However, Mr Kenneth presents a very interesting experiment to Nairobi city&nbsp;politics&nbsp;as we are likely to see the&nbsp;political&nbsp;supremacy between Mt Kenya and Western Kenya unfold,&rdquo; he says. 2022&nbsp;politics ALSO READ: Kalonzo: Coordinating committee cannot choose NASA flagbearer Prof Jacob Midiwo of the University of Nairobi says Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has positioned himself strategically to inherit&nbsp;Raila&rsquo;s&nbsp;support base because of displaying signs of&nbsp;being&nbsp;a fearless and brave&nbsp;leader, credentials that are exciting to the&nbsp;ODM&nbsp;leader&rsquo;s&nbsp;supporters. He says ANC&nbsp;leader&nbsp;Musalia Mudavadi also stands a great chance of inheriting&nbsp;Raila&rsquo;s&nbsp;support base as he has managed to sanitise himself from the Moi-Kenyatta&nbsp;influence. Prof Midiwo says the stiff competition among&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;aspirants for the governor&rsquo;s seat in Nairobi is a strategy towards the 2022 presidential race. &ldquo;President&nbsp;Kenyatta&rsquo;s&nbsp;supporters are pretending they will support Mr Ruto in 2022, but they are shoring up Mr Kenneth&rsquo;s candidature for Nairobi governor with an eye on 2022,&rdquo; he says.
