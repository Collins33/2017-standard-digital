Violence has characterised political party nominations across the country. Kisumu, particularly, has been hard hit. Physical fights and the burning of tyres on the roads have been witnessed. It beats imagination what burning a tyre on a tarmac road in protest of whatever thing is set to achieve other than cause damage to infrastructure that was erected at great cost to the taxpayer. A few people have lost their lives, while others nurse serious wounds following fights over contested poll results. And while the poor in society fight over politicians, some losers in the nominations exercise appear to have sunk to a new low. Conceding defeat in any contest is a mark of maturity. Kiambu Governor William Kabogo led the way after conceding defeat to his challenger Ferdinand Waititu long before the final count was in. He chose not to challenge the outcome. It is particularly saddening and alarming that after beating her opponents in the Mbita Constituency ODM nominations, first, Millie Odhiambo&#39;s bodyguard was killed in a curious accident on Monday. The following day her rural home in Urianda village, Mbita, was razed by people suspected to be her opponents. We shouldn&#39;t let contests sink that low. As the police try to get the suspects, it is important that the will of the people be respected and peace be maintained. ALSO READ: Incumbent MPs lose out to newcomers and political greenhorns
