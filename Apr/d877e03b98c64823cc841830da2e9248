The body of a middle aged man said to be among the most wanted terror suspects has been found dumped at the Naivasha sub-county hospital mortuary. Relatives of Fareed Omar Awal could not hold back tears after a one-month search for the missing trader and family man. Also found in the morgue was Fatma Mohammed, who hails from Malindi, and has been missing for the same period. Their bodies were found last month, dumped in an abandoned field near Mt Longonot National Park off the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road, by a group of herders. They had been strangled using wires, and there were indications that some chemical had been poured on parts of their bodies to hide their identity. The bodies have been lying at the morgue until Sunday evening when they were identified.&nbsp;&nbsp;
