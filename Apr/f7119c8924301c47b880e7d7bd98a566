Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba has declared his interest in the presidency during the 2022 elections. Speaking in Kimaeti, Mr Ababu hinted at going for the top office in 2022 after consolidating his support base. He said the Labour Party of Kenya will not field any presidential candidate in the August elections but will do so for the other elective seats throughout the country. &ldquo;This year our party is not having a presidential candidate but I am sure in 2022 we will have one person on the ballot. For now, we are focused on popularising the party to make it stronger for the next elections,&rdquo; he said. The MP called on NASA principals Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula to fight for the Opposition&rsquo;s presidential ticket. He said should there be no Luhya presidential hopeful from the western region, he would front himself during the 2022 General Election. ALSO READ: Stop following me, CS Matiang'i tells Governor Ongwae
