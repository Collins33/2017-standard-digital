Traffic policemen and officers from the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) continue to subject motorists to the breathalyser test. This goes on despite last week&#39;s ban on Alcoblow by the Court of Appeal, terming its use illegal.&nbsp; While the court noted the police and NTSA could still employ the use of the gadget, its test could not be used to charge a motorist in a court of law. Consequently, motorists arrested after the courts order were freed. This has however not detracted NTSA from charging drivers after testing them. NTSA Director General Francis Meja argues the authority has not received the court order to effect it. When a law enforcement agency blatantly disrespects court orders, it sends out the wrong message. NTSA&#39;s zeal for Alcoblow in light of what has been happening on the roads does not stem from a genuine desire to stop drink-driving since drunk drivers proceed with their journeys after parting with bribes. Alcoblow is equally unhealthy as it exposes motorists to such health dangers like tuberculosis, colds and flu. There is no proof that Alcoblow has significantly reduced road accidents. Other factors like unmarked roads, un-roadworthy vehicles, driver fatigue and missing signage continue to be leading causes of accidents. Obeying court orders is not optional and NTSA should address itself to these other causes to reduce road accidents. ALSO READ: Use of Alcoblow is illegal: Court declares
