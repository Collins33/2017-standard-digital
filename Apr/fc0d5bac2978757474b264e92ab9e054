KISUMU, KENYA: The rising political temperature in the country has raised major concerns in business sector across the country with more investors shifting to other countries in East Africa and Africa at large. Speaking during an interview with the Standard, Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE) CEO, Jacqueline Mugo said that most business persons have developed fear as Kenya approaches the election period, including manufacturers, producers and general employers. &quot;With the rising temperatures in the country&rsquo;s politics right now, most of the business persons have developed fear that they will record losses if the temperatures are not contained,&quot; said Mugo. The CEO further stated that during the 2007/2008 post-election violence, business sector was the most affected having more than 2000 businesses closed down. She said that the violence experienced in most parts of the country led to huge losses by the business persons. &quot;There is concern where most employers are in wait and see scenario as we get closer to the elections. In the previous election we recorded losses after most businesses were closed down following post-election violence. The looting that was done in other parts, also caused a major breakdown in the businesses,&quot; she said. Mugo however called on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to put measures that will ensure that elections are done in a free and fair way, saying that the outcome will determine the reaction of the people and the fate of businesses.
