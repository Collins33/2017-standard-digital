Ebenezer Holy Bible Church Reverend Catherine Kagwiria has announced her bid for the Woman Representative seat. Rev Kagwiria, who claimed she was rigged out during the 2013 ODM primaries, said she will vie on a Maendeleo Chap Chap ticket. Kagwiria claimed she had been approached by incumbent, Florence Kajuju, to drop her bid, but that she had refused. The aspirant said if elected, she would push for jobs for the youth and women. She accused the incumbent of being ineffective and forgetting women and youth.
