Wiper Democratic Movement party leader Kalonzo Musyoka is the glue holding the National Super Alliance together, Kitui Governor Julius Malombe has said. Dr Malombe sensationally claimed when the die is finally cast, Kalonzo would be the ideal Opposition presidential bet because he would be easily marketable. He observed that NASA was poised to grab the presidency in the August 8 General Election on condition that the four co-principals; Raila Odinga (ODM), Musalia Mudavadi (Amani), Moses Wetang&#39;ula (Ford-Kenya) and Kalonzo - stick together. &quot;NASA is the next government in waiting if the four co-principals won&#39;t split,&quot; he said. He was speaking in Kyuso in Mwingi North when he drummed up support for his gubernatorial candidature at Wiper. He says the leaders should stick together in order to have an impact in political circles. ALSO READ: Raila's about-turn to back presidential system hurting him
