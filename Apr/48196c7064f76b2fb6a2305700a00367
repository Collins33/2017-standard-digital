Court has granted the prosecution 15 days to investigate a Nairobi MCA suspected of murdering a man at a rally. The rally was disrupted by his rival&#39;s supporters leading to violence and chaos at Huruma. Prosecutor Catherine Mwaniki, who appeared before Principal Magistrate Benson Nzakyo, said the investigations had not been completed.&quot;There is death in this matter, grievous harm and damage to property which we are investigating,&quot; said Ms Mwaniki. Huruma MCA Peter Owera Oluoch, Oduor, Elly Owuor Onura, Dennis Otieno Omollo Raphael Willy Obunga, Peter Mwangi Kariuki and Daniel Okumu Ongongo and five others were present in court Wednesday. The suspects were arrested by police officers on the same date with alleged offence of murder contrary to the law.&nbsp;
