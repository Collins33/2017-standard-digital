Former Assembly Minority Leader&nbsp;Karisa Nzai Munyika has accused ODM of trying to block him from contesting in the August 8 polls. He further claims the party has registered him as an ODM aspirant for the Jomvu Parliamentary seat. According to the ODM final list of aspirants, Nzai will be vying for the ticket together with current MP Bady Twalib Bady and newcomer Dan Aluora Oloo. The Jomvu Ward Rep says he is a paid up member of Jubilee Party and that he will trounce his opponents on a JP ticket. &nbsp;&quot;This is their way of eliminating me from the race because they know that I am their most formidable opponent,&quot; he said. &nbsp;The Coast Jubilee Chairman, Matano Chengo warned that they were giving ODM seven days to apologise to Karisa Nzai otherwise they will take action.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Kanu aspirants ask voters to reject Jubilee
