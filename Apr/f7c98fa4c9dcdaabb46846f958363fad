Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi (PHOTO;EVANS HABIL) Allies of Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi Thursday dismissed results of an opinion poll that shows him trailing Governor Peter Munya by a huge margin. The senator&#39;s allies claimed the poll results by Infotrak Harris, which showed Kiraitu polling 29.9 per cent against Munya&rsquo;s 41.1 per cent was doctored for political expediency. Kiraitu&#39;s Director of Communications Patrick Muriungi said they had conducted their own poll that indicated Kiraitu had 48 per cent to Munya&rsquo;s 41 per cent support. Linford Mutembei, the chairman of the Jubilee allied Mt Kenya Youth Caucus weighed in, saying the polls had painted a completely different picture from what was on the ground. But Tigania West MP David Kariithi said the opinion poll was credible and reflected the reality on the ground.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Let peace be the rallying call during party primaries
