Aspirants seeking Jubilee Party and Ford Kenya tickets have launched door-to-door campaigns ahead of primaries slated for April 21 and 24 respectively. Jubilee county chairman, Richard Chesebe, has warned aspirants against engaging in violence as they risk being disqualified. Jubilee aspirants led by Woman Representative Janet Nangabo mounted campaigns in several areas. Ms Nangabo held a road show in the company of other Jubilee leaders to also popularise the party in the county. The MP exuded confidence in clinching the party ticket despite facing opposition from her 2013 competitor Eunice Karanja. &quot;Let nobody mislead you to reject Jubilee. President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, are going to form the next government. I urge Luhyas especially the Bukusus not to isolate themselves from the government,&quot; she said at Kwanza.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Jubilee Party prepares for Mombasa primaries
