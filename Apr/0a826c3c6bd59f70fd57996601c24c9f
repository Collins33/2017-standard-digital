&nbsp; Hotly contested Jubilee Party primaries are expected today in Kiambu, Kericho, and Uasin Gishu counties. In Kiambu, Governor William Kabogo will face off with Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu. In Uasin Gishu, Governor Jackson Mandago and businessman Kiprop Bundotich alias Buzeki are tussling for the ruling coalition&rsquo;s ticket. In Kericho, Governor Paul Chepkwony&rsquo;s re-election bid faces competition from a former NSSF managing trustee, Richard Langat, and Ainamoi MP Benjamin Langat. At the same time, the party has once again postponed primaries in Murang&rsquo;a, Turkana, Samburu, and Marsabit counties, which were planned for today to tomorrow, citing logistics.

And for the third day running, Deputy President William Ruto was yesterday at the party&rsquo;s headquarters to supervise the preparations for the high-stakes exercise. Mr Ruto took charge of the primaries following Friday&rsquo;s spectacular failure that saw primaries in 21 counties cancelled. Ruto arrived at the offices at noon and stayed past 5.30pm. The party has directed its poll officials to allow all adults with national IDs to participate in its primaries. This is in disregard to the electoral law that dictates that only registered party members be allowed to vote.&nbsp;
