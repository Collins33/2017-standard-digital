NAIROBI: The&nbsp;Government&nbsp;is keen to distribute wealth to traditionally marginalised&nbsp;groups&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;youth, women and people with disabilities &ndash; by improving&nbsp;access&nbsp;to tenders. In&nbsp;2012,&nbsp;former&nbsp;President&nbsp;Mwai&nbsp;Kibaki&nbsp;set&nbsp;aside&nbsp;10&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent&nbsp;of&nbsp;all&nbsp;Government&nbsp;contracts&nbsp;for the&nbsp;youth. The&nbsp;following&nbsp;year,&nbsp;President&nbsp;Uhuru&nbsp;Kenyatta&nbsp;increased&nbsp;this to&nbsp;30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent,&nbsp;expanded&nbsp;the&nbsp;access&nbsp;groups&nbsp;and&nbsp;directed&nbsp;that they&nbsp;face&nbsp;no&nbsp;competition&nbsp;from&nbsp;established&nbsp;companies. However, according to Tenders Unlimited, a matchmaking website that tracks public and private tender pairings, the&nbsp;youth&nbsp;have taken up a mere&nbsp;30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent&nbsp;of the opportunities made available to them. &ldquo;From&nbsp;our engagements with the&nbsp;Government, they say participation is poor, especially among the&nbsp;youth&nbsp;who are applying for less than&nbsp;30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent&nbsp;of what is on offer. The women are trying a bit more,&rdquo; says Ali Omar, the team leader at Tenders Unlimited. The reason The reason may be in the data the firm has collected over the&nbsp;years. Tenders Unlimited is one of the main online platforms offering advertising space for tenders&nbsp;from&nbsp;private businesses, publicly listed&nbsp;companies, NGOs, parastatals, county&nbsp;governments&nbsp;and the national&nbsp;government. There are other players in this space, including Tenders Soko and Tenders Kenya, though Ali says his firm was the pioneer. According to Tenders Unlimited data analysed by&nbsp;Hustle, the&nbsp; problem appears to be in the disconnect between what the&nbsp;Government&nbsp;is offering and what young Kenyans can deliver. For example, the top three&nbsp;Government&nbsp;offers are 5,474 general supplies tenders, 3,523 engineering and construction deals and 2,885 professional service tenders. However, the&nbsp;youth&nbsp;concentrated their bids on ICT&nbsp;contracts. The most popular search in the data covering January 2014 to January 2017 shows ICT tenders drew 37,912 searches. &ldquo;People are searching for ICT because they are more familiar with it, especially in the supply of things like computers and accessories, which are easier to do and have good margins,&rdquo; Ali says. Engineering and construction drew 16,806 searches, while professional services had 15,468 searches to round off the top three most popular searches &ndash; and surpassing the number of available tenders three and five times over, respectively. General supplies tenders drew just over 5,000 searches, despite having the most&nbsp;contracts&nbsp;available. &ldquo;The&nbsp;youth&nbsp;sometimes complain that the small tenders for general supplies are the most prevalent but are less lucrative because the profit margins are small and the payment comes late, so they are a bit discouraged,&rdquo; Ali says. These lower-value&nbsp;contracts&nbsp;address funding challenges, but may not necessarily deliver the policy agenda of enabling the biggest segment of the country&rsquo;s population to create wealth. Further, agriculture has got little attention in terms of the tenders on offer&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Government&nbsp;and interest&nbsp;from&nbsp;young people, despite Kenya being a largely agricultural economy. These mismatches may explain why&nbsp;President&nbsp;Kenyatta&nbsp;was disappointed in the slow progress recorded by&nbsp;Access&nbsp;to&nbsp;Government&nbsp;Procurement Opportunities (AGPO), and threatened to sack State officials last October. &ldquo;AGPO is now law. It is not a question of policy. I promise you will not hide or be transferred. You will leave and create opportunities for those who are willing to abide by the law,&rdquo;&nbsp;Uhuru&nbsp;said. In their defence, public sector officials have claimed that the&nbsp;youth&nbsp;are not interested in applying for AGPO&nbsp;contracts, and that those who take up the offers are unable to implement them. They also claim the&nbsp;youth&nbsp;are unable to fill in the forms correctly, which has seen Tenders Unlimited move into offering capacity building services. The online firm charges its users a monthly subscription fee of Sh600 for targeted tender advertisements, an online directory for SMEs, and assistance in filling in tender forms, though this attracts an additional fee. The&nbsp;youth&nbsp;on their part claim that they cannot get&nbsp;contracts&nbsp;unless they have patronage, and blame corruption for their low participation. Volume or value However, there appears to have been little discussion on whether the opportunities available match market realities, which may explain why some tenders get more bids than others. Another question that has been raised is whether the&nbsp;30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent&nbsp;quota should refer to the volume of tenders or their value. Between&nbsp;Uhuru&rsquo;s 2013&nbsp;directive&nbsp;and June 2015, tenders worth Sh24 billion were allocated to&nbsp;youth, women and people living with disabilities. In the 2013-14 financial&nbsp;year, ministries&nbsp;set&nbsp;aside&nbsp;Sh21.7 billion as part of the&nbsp;30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent&nbsp;procurement quota, yet they only issued tenders worth Sh6.5 billion. The&nbsp;following&nbsp;financial&nbsp;year, ministries&nbsp;set&nbsp;aside&nbsp;contracts&nbsp;worth Sh17.07 billion, and issued tenders valued at Sh16.68 billion. In the&nbsp;year&nbsp;to June 2016, Sh17.7 billion worth of tenders was&nbsp;setaside, but data on the performance is difficult to come by. With the&nbsp;Government&nbsp;still intent on getting to the&nbsp;30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent&nbsp;target, it is likely that scaling down on the value of tenders may have been offset by the volume of&nbsp;contracts&nbsp;issued. But can data be used to come up with tenders for&nbsp;youth, women and those living with disabilities by identifying their interests and customising&nbsp;contracts&nbsp;to suit their capabilities?&nbsp; The private sector has been unable to do this as it has fewer tenders on offer or available to a cross-section of participants. Tenders Unlimited data over the January 2014 to January 2017 period shows that the most common tenders issued by listed&nbsp;companies&nbsp;were for professional services (1,020), general supplies (860), ICT (639) and general services (555).
