MALABA, KENYA: The government is planning to put in place new improved digital custom systems at the Busia and Malaba borders to curb the smuggling menace. Speaking in Busia, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) Deputy Commissioner Kevin Safari said the tax collector was aware that some people were using shortcuts to ferry in goods from neighboring country to avoid paying tax. Mr Safari disclosed that the objective of setting up the systems is to create level playground for the business community operating on the borders. KRA has been unable to win the fight against illegal entry of goods from Uganda through porous borders. For instance in Busia county business persons have established routes in Bulanda, Mulwanda and Adungosi where they are using to carry out the vice. Once the system is up and running, one will not import or export any cargo unless you have a KRA PIN and you have been paying tax.

We want people to pay tax and do clean business,&quot; he added.
