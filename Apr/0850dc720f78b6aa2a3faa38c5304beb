Nairobi Woman Representative aspirant Wangui Ng&#39;ang&#39;a has supported the decision to drop the use of smart cards in the Jubilee Party primaries. &quot;Recruiting party members through the smart cards was a good idea as it just shows JP is a progressive party. But we must guard against undemocratic practices where wealthy aspirants run roughshod against the not well endowed financially,&quot; she said during a meeting with women leaders in Kasarani Wednesday. Jubilee will conduct its primaries on April 21 across the country. Ms Ng&#39;ang&#39;a said she was ready for the nominations and was confident of winning the seat. &quot;I will provide visionary leadership and not be entangled in unnecessary sideshows,&quot; she said.&nbsp;
