Uchumi&nbsp;Supermarkets&nbsp;is&nbsp;readying&nbsp;itself&nbsp;to&nbsp;return&nbsp;to&nbsp;Uganda&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tanzania,&nbsp;despite&nbsp;having&nbsp;burnt&nbsp;its&nbsp;fingers&nbsp;in the&nbsp;two&nbsp;markets. The retailer operated in the&nbsp;two&nbsp;countries for five years without profits before throwing in the towel in 2015. The company, however, is yet to finalise the payment of debts to suppliers in the&nbsp;two&nbsp;markets&nbsp;since it shut down operations. Uchumi&nbsp;Supermarkets&nbsp;CEO Julius Kipng&rsquo;etich said the retailer would take a more cautious approach, initially operating one outlet to gauge&nbsp;market&nbsp;sentiment before expanding. &ldquo;Our strategy in the&nbsp;two&nbsp;markets&nbsp;was wrong. We took stores in bad locations and that is what affected operations. We&nbsp;havesuffered a case of poor locations in Kenya in the past, but&nbsp;Uganda&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tanzania&nbsp;were the worst,&rdquo; he said. He, however, declined to say when the retailer would be going back to the&nbsp;two&nbsp;countries.

It expects to receive the second tranche in April or May. The Treasury agreed to give the retailer a bailout of Sh1.2 billion.&nbsp;Uchumi&nbsp;is also expecting Sh600 million that will be used to pay suppliers in&nbsp;Uganda&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tanzania, bringing the total shareholder loan to Sh1.8 billion. The retail chain has in the recent past experienced a drop in foot traffic due to empty shelves in&nbsp;its&nbsp;stores. Kipng&rsquo;etich said the money advanced by the Treasury would help in stocking. &ldquo;Our customers are going to see change ... we will leverage on the funding from Government together with goodwill from suppliers to increase the stock in the outlets,&rdquo; he said. Kipng&rsquo;etich added that&nbsp;Uchumi&nbsp;is still shopping for a strategic investor to raise Sh5 billion to fund operations.
