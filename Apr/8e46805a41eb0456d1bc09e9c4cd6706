NAIROBI, KENYA: Communications Authority of Kenya has ordered Safaricom to provide explanation on what happened to its network paralyzing operations in many services. Safaricom subscribers could not by Monday morning access data, voice, sms, M-pesa and Enterprise services following an outage that crippled its network. &ldquo;We are waiting for Safaricom to give us an explanation about what happened because we were also in a blackout and we even had to send someone physically to their office to get in touch,&rdquo; explained Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) Director-General Francis Wangusi. &ldquo;We are seeking an explanation about what happened because every operator needs to adhere to a 99.99 per cent up-time, with redundancy provisions for network down-times,&rdquo; said Mr Wangusi. In a statement, Safaricom confirmed a technical hitch adding that the situation has since been addressed.

The firm is also the only operator currently running an active 4G network after purchasing a licence early last month.
