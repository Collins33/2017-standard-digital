Mr Mwadime garnered 6,674 votes against his rival, Christopher Mwambingu&rsquo;s 5,248 in Tuesday&rsquo;s hotly contested party primary characterised by challenges. The incumbent was declared the winner by the constituency returning officer, Arafat Machila, in Mwatate town yesterday morning. Mr Mwadime said the exercise was credible. &ldquo;I have won the ODM nomination in a free and fair contest,&rdquo; said the legislator after the results were announced.

The loser claimed his supporters were intimidated in various polling stations and were not allowed to vote by the supporters of the incumbent MP. &ldquo;My supporters were not allowed to vote, especially in areas perceived to be my rival&rsquo;s strongholds. There was also massive voter bribery and double voting in some polling stations in the vast constituency,&rdquo; Mr Mwambingu claimed. Addressing the press in Mwatate town yesterday, Mwambingu and his supporters asked the party&rsquo;s national nomination board to nullify the results. &ldquo;Late delivery of election materials in our strongholds such as Bura and Rong&rsquo;e Juu wards and massive voter bribery showed that the county election board was compromised,&rdquo; claimed Mwambingu. In Voi Constituency, the incumbent MP, Jones Mlolwa, was given a ticket after failing to get an opponent.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Opinion: Poll results- Whose call is it anyway?
