Public servants have a right to interact with citizens to give details on improved service delivery under President Uhuru Kenyatta, State House Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu has said. Speaking at Eldoret State Lodge Sunday morning during his weekly press briefing, Mr Esipisu said Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and other senior staff cadre have to account for the trillions of shillings collected and invested in development projects. &ldquo;They have to account for the trillions of shillings in taxes collected from the Kenyan people and invested in infrastructure development and other services; and they have to account for the confidence invested in them by the Kenyan people,&rdquo; he said. The State House Spokesperson was responding to questions on whether public servants are playing politics by speaking at public barazas and talking about the direction the country is heading. &ldquo;Why are they supporting the President and the Jubilee administration, some of you have asked? Because they are accountable to the President who appointed them in the first place, and whose vision of service to the Kenyan people it is their duty to operationalise,&rdquo; said Mr Esipisu. On the question of whether the public servants are campaigning for the President, Mr Esipisu said they are not and that they were merely describing the investments made under President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s administration and why it was important for the President to be re-elected to continue with the task of transforming Kenya.

It is precisely because public officers are speaking more that the country acknowledges that Kenya is irreversibly transforming,&rdquo; said the State House Spokesperson.
