At least 60,000 staff have been recruited to manage Jubilee Party (JP) nominations slated for Friday. JP Secretary General Raphael Tuju said each of the 20,000 polling stations across 33 counties will be manned by at least three staff. With fears of the kind of chaos witnessed in ODM&nbsp;primaries, Mr Tuju has warned both supporters and aspirants not to dare, adding there will be consequences. He said JP has requested for enough security for both the ballot papers and voting. &quot;If you are found dealing in any kind of violence, you will be disqualified if you are a candidate or jailed. It will be unfortunate but please, do not test our resolve,&quot; Mr Tuju said. In preparation for the nominations, the 8,021 aspirants for all positions have up to Wednesday 7pm to campaign as per the released timetable.
