Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba&nbsp;faces an uphill task to retain his seat after ODM aspirants seeking to unseat him ganged up and struck a deal. The aspirants have vowed to support whoever will clinch the ODM ticket to ensure Namwamba is defeated in the August polls. ODM will hold its party primaries in Busia County this Friday. The Budalang&rsquo;i seat has attracted five candidates seeking ODM ticket. They include former area MP Raphael Wanjala, former County Executive Committee member Leonard Obimbira, Albert Gumo, David Obara and Andrew Nakitare.
