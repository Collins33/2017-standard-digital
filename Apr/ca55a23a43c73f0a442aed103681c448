Two people were Saturday&nbsp;burnt&nbsp;to death in two separate fire incidences in Kisumu. In the first incident, a five-year baby was&nbsp;burnt&nbsp;to death when their grass-thatched house caught fire in Wawidhi village, Nyando Sub-County. Kisumu Police Commander Titus Yoma said the boy&#39;s parents were attending a funeral in a neighbouring home and had lit a tin lamp which started the fire. Efforts by residents to put out the 2am fire were futile. And in Kisumu&#39;s Ondiek estate, quick response by residents and the fire brigade to stop a raging inferno ignited by a stove from consuming up to five houses and several iron sheet shanties failed. The owner of the single-roomed shanty in which the fire is believed to have started died in the 1am incident.
