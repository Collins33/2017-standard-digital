Chaos erupted at Mwatate CDF Hall on Monday when a group of rowdy youths disrupted a training session for election officials for the Taita-Taveta ODM party primaries. According to the police and party officials, the youth destroyed property of an unknown value during the fracas that lasted hours until security personnel intervened and restored order. Mwatate OCPD Francis Mwangi said the youths were complaining that the election officials were drawn from one region and demanded the primaries be postponed to address this. Police said the youth were complaining the nominations would not be free and fair due to this. Governor John Mruttu, who will face Wundanyi MP Thomas Mwadeghu in the primaries, called for peace and tolerance ahead of Tuesday&#39;s nominations.
