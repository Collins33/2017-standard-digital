NAIVASHA, KENYA: The fishing of crayfish in Lake Naivasha by a group of Chinese investors has now been stopped after a sharp drop in the catch. The foreign investors are now buying the fish species from dams in Kinangop in Nyandarua County after it emerged that the lake could not sustain the production of crayfish. The move comes a week after tens of fish were found dead along South Lake in unclear circumstances with stakeholders pointing an accusing finger at each other. According to the county director of fisheries Mathew Ngila, crayfish production was seasonal and hence the move by the investor to seek alternative source of the fish. Speaking on phone, Ngila said that research has indicated that the infamous Common Carp species was feeding on the crayfish and hence the drop in the catch. &quot;We have seen an increase in the production and size of common carp species but also recorded a sharp drop in crayfish catch,&quot; he said.
