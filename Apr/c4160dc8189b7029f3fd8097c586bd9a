Eldoret National Polytechnic Wednesday sought to address governance with its play Moshi Mweupe at the ongoing national drama festival in Kisumu. The play deploys use of the gun to show how the ruling class abuses power. Instead of protecting the people, powerful individuals torment them. Moshi Mweupe is centred around brothers, Pkopus and Poviot, whose families are in constant conflict. Poviot, who is illiterate, hates his brother. Pkopus holds a degree from an international university. His bitterness goes beyond sibling rivalry. One day, it pushes him beyond limits. Poviot storms the wedding of Pkopus&rsquo; son and opens fire on the guests. The groom is injured in the melee.&nbsp; Several children are killed in the ensuing stampede. When the dust has settled, the bride, Maria, asks women in the neighbourhood to help in resolving the differences between Poviot and Pkopus. &ldquo;I urge all of us to boycott warming their bedrooms until these men decide to live peacefully,&rdquo; say Maria.
