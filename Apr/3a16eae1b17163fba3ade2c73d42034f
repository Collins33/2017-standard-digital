NAIROBI, KENYA: KCB Foundation has signed a partnership with Kenya Institute of Special Education (KISE) that will see bright needy students living with disabilities access quality education under the Foundation&rsquo;s scholarship program. The deal is to help develop and execute mechanisms to enable effective management and mentorship of the scholarship beneficiaries with disability. &ldquo;The partnership will see KCB Foundation identify and assist in recruiting students with disability across the country for its scholarship programme, while KISE will work to provide guidelines for identification and recruitment of the students,&rdquo; said KCB Foundation Executive Director Jane Mwangi. &ldquo;Education is one of the most crucial investments a country can make in its people and the country&rsquo;s future. It is a critical driver in the reduction of poverty and the importance of making education inclusive to children living with disabilities cannot be overstated,&rdquo; she said. According to a report by the Special School Heads Association of Kenya (2016), one in every ten Kenyans under the age of 21 is disabled. This translates to a situation where only 45,000 special needs students are in school.
