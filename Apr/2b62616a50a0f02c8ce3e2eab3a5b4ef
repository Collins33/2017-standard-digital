The Government has shifted focus from creating new universities to enhancing quality in the existing ones. University Education&nbsp;Principal Secretary Collete Suda said the country has 31 public and 40 private universities. Prof Suda said as from last year, the Commission for University Education carried out a countrywide quality audit in all universities to establish compliance with standards and operations. She said the audit was concluded in February and the results released by Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i on February 16, this year. &quot;The findings of the audit will form the basis of forward planning to ensure quality remains in focus at all times. The Government will not relent in its quest to streamline education to respond to our needs as a country,&quot; said Suda. She spoke during the fourth graduation ceremony at Southern Eastern Kenya University (SEKU) main campus in Kwavonza, Kitui County where 1,035 students graduated with degrees and diplomas.
