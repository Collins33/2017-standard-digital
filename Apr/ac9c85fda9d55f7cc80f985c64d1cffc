&nbsp; Last year at this time, the country was savouring the exploits of the Rugby Sevens team, Shujaa after it won the Rugby Sevens cup during the Singapore circuit, the first time in history. The 30-7 win was sweet revenge for a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Fijians in 1998 when they were resoundingly beaten 71&mdash;0 at the Commonwealth Games held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. But alas, that is not the case this year. After a poor show in the South Africa in December, many rugby fans had hoped that the team would pick up the pieces and put a good show in Singapore. That didn&rsquo;t happen. Innocent Simiyu&rsquo;s team crashed out after losing 13-12 to England and 23-21 against New Zealand. Canada beat the United States 26-19 to win the title yesterday. It was hoped that the team would build on the success that not only markets Brand Kenya globally, but also catalyses cohesiveness and unity of purpose in a country where grandstanding is common in the political arena. The implosion of the Shujaas in the 2017 season tempts one to conclude that last year&rsquo;s win was a matter of happenstance. Yet it was not. It actually was a long painstaking process that spoke volumes of what team work, togetherness and resilience could achieve. The team showed that it had what it takes to make it to the top. All that should not be let to go away. The hope and pride our sportsmen and women bring the country cannot be underestimated. It should be reinforced.
