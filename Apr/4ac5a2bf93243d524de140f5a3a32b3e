Nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro and Migori Governor Okoth Obado have been fined Sh3 million for causing violence. Orange party disciplinary committee has recommended that Ongoro be fined Sh1 million and that she contests in another constituency - not Ruaraka- for storming Orange House party headquarters in Nairobi. Mr Obado will pay Sh2 million. The senator has also been directed to publicly and in writing apologise to party leader Raila Odinga and Executive Director Oduor Ong&rsquo;wen. Ong&rsquo;wen explained the senator&rsquo;s conduct in storming Orange House and holding the staff at ransom is totally unacceptable and cannot be condoned. Migori Governor Okoth Obado&nbsp; &ldquo;On this account, we find Senator Ongoro culpable and in breach of the party&rsquo;s code of conduct and recommend that she is strongly reprimanded,&rdquo; reads part of the committee&rsquo;s report.

It was the committee&rsquo;s purview that allowing both of them (Ongoro and MP TJ Kajwang&rsquo;) will only escalate the violence,&rdquo; said Mr Ong&rsquo;wen. He further said it would have been impractical for the incumbent to be told to relocate yet he was defending his seat. Obado was ordered to submit a written apology to the party leader.
