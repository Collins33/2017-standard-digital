A Meru court has lifted a warrant of arrest issued against a teacher accused of sexually abusing ten pupils. Julius Mwiti&nbsp;accompanied by his lawyer George Mugambi appeared before Meru chief Magistrate Lucy Ambasi for the hearing of the case. Mwiti pleaded with the court not to cancel his Sh1 million bail on grounds he was not aware he was required to appear in court on certain dates. On March 23, the court summoned Meru county Teachers Service Commission (TSC) director to explain the teacher&rsquo;s whereabouts after police claimed he had gone into hiding. The prosecution led by James Kinyua sought to know the whereabouts of the teacher. Mwiti had skipped the case hearing twice. On December 14 last year, the court issued the first warrant of arrest after he failed to appear in court for the hearings where four parents were scheduled to testify. The summons were extended on January 9 and March 22, which he skipped. Investigating Officer Corporal Rosemary Njoki said efforts to arrest the teacher had failed. The hearing continues on June 7.
