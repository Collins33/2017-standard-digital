Homa Bay, Kenya: The State has been challenged to cushion Lake Victoria fishermen from frustrations of Ugandan security personnel. Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo expressed concern over the frustratiions which fishermen on Remba Island undergo due to persistent arrest by Ugandan security officers. Addressing journalists in Homa Bay town, Ms Odhiambo called on the government to provide security to the fishermen. She said the harassment by Ugandan security officials to fishermen in the island is a drawback to the fishermen&#39;s income. The Legislator said the island is hosting both Kenyan and Ugandan security personnel and peaceful coexistence is required. &quot;Remba Island is home to Ugandan and Kenyan fishermen and they have co-existed for well many years. The Kenya Government should do all it takes to ensure peaceful coexistence,&quot; said Ms Odhiambo. Homa Bay County Beach Management Network Chairperson Edward Oremo said some of the fishermen had undergone torture by Ugandan security personnel. He called on the government to investigate the claims of torture perpetrated in the island. Mr Oremo said that that the fishermen have lost fish worth Sh1 million to cartels in the lake in the last two weeks, creating fear that anarchy might find its way back to other islands in the lake. &quot;Kenyan fishermen in the highland have lost fish valued close to Sh1 million to cartels in the lake. I appeal to the government to protect our fishermen,&quot; said Oremo.
