On&nbsp;November&nbsp;16,&nbsp;2016, a&nbsp;man&nbsp;walked&nbsp;into a&nbsp;Family&nbsp;Bank&nbsp;branch&nbsp;and&nbsp;demanded&nbsp;to&nbsp;withdraw&nbsp;Sh8&nbsp;million&nbsp;that&nbsp;he&nbsp;had&nbsp;saved&nbsp;overthe&nbsp;years. This was after rumours spread on social media that the lender would be closed by the Central&nbsp;Bank&nbsp;of Kenya (CBK). He&nbsp;was not taking no for an answer from the frantic managers who were trying to calm thousands of customers who, like him, wanted their money. Three financial institutions &mdash; Dubai, Imperial and Chase&nbsp;banks&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;had&nbsp;been placed under receivership. Going by past incidents where depositors wait for long to be paid or only got a fraction of their&nbsp;savings&nbsp;when lenders were placed under statutory management, this time, customers wanted their money before things got worse. For&nbsp;Family&nbsp;Bank, this particular client camped at one of its two&nbsp;branches&nbsp;that stay open till 8pm, waiting to get his cash. Eventually,&nbsp;he&nbsp;left the&nbsp;bank&nbsp;on night of&nbsp;November&nbsp;16&nbsp;with&nbsp;Sh8&nbsp;million&nbsp;in cash but realised his mistake when&nbsp;he&nbsp;spotted other people and started imagining they were after him. &ldquo;He&nbsp;started feeling very scared. So&nbsp;he&nbsp;weighed his options: &lsquo;If I go home these fellows will take the money, if I go back to that&nbsp;bank, they say it is going to shut, now what do I do?&rsquo;,&rdquo; a more reassured&nbsp;Family&nbsp;Bank&nbsp;CEO David Thuku, told Weekend Business. The&nbsp;man, terrified, scampered back into the&nbsp;banking&nbsp;hall and offered&nbsp;Family&nbsp;Bank&nbsp;managers a deal. They could take the money, but only if they did not put it in the&nbsp;bank&rsquo;s&nbsp;system.

After staying in the&nbsp;bank&nbsp;for an hour,&nbsp;hedecided to redeposit the cash,&rdquo; Mr Thuku said. Thuku was a&nbsp;man&nbsp;under siege for five days during which the&nbsp;bank&nbsp;he&nbsp;had&nbsp;overseen for barely a&nbsp;year&nbsp;lost more than Sh23 billion in one of the worst&nbsp;bank&nbsp;runs in Kenya. He&nbsp;admits that deposits went down from Sh62 billion to Sh39 billion in under a week. &ldquo;Someone would tell us, we lost money in Chase&nbsp;Bank, we lost money in Imperial, so we understood. Like fund managers, if you are investing on behalf of people and the money goes, you get fired, so we understood and said, &lsquo;You come take your money but we are not going anywhere, when you see that, please bring back the money&rsquo;,&rdquo;&nbsp;he&nbsp;said. It is easy for Thuku to talk about those dramatic five days now that&nbsp;Family&nbsp;Bank&nbsp;is firmly back on track. Although their net profit fell 82 per cent to Sh352&nbsp;million&nbsp;due to the&nbsp;bank&nbsp;run, the lender is the recovery path. During the crisis, customer deposits dropped to Sh39 billion but rose to Sh41 billion as at December&nbsp;2016. Sacked managers Family&nbsp;Bank&rsquo;s&nbsp;problems started a few months earlier after CBK unravelled a scheme where National Youth Service (NYS) money was wired through the lender. It was later fined Sh1&nbsp;million. Faulu Micro Finance Ltd and Sidian&nbsp;Bank, formerly K-Rep, also&nbsp;had&nbsp;to part with Sh1&nbsp;million&nbsp;fine each.

The&nbsp;bank&rsquo;s&nbsp;boss, Peter Munyiri, left in June last&nbsp;year, having served the&nbsp;bank&nbsp;for five&nbsp;years. Mr Munyiri would later join his former colleagues in the dock for failing to report the infamous Josephine Kabura and Ben Gethi transactions. &ldquo;I am not worried much that our name will keep coming up&nbsp;over&nbsp;the NYS issue. In life, there are things that will hit you. Some will hit you unexpectedly, some will hit you because of some negligence you have done somewhere. You pick your lessons for the things that hit you and then do the corrective measures you need to do,&rdquo; Thuku said. The image of the agony of depositors waiting for their money outside Imperial&nbsp;Bank&nbsp;and Chase&nbsp;Bank&nbsp;was still fresh in the minds of depositors, and&nbsp;Family&nbsp;Bank&nbsp;was expected to follow the three lenders into the wasteland. When Thuku&nbsp;walked&nbsp;into his office at 7am on&nbsp;November&nbsp;17,&nbsp;he&nbsp;called CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge, who was rumoured to be on his way to shut down the lender. &ldquo;The governor said, &lsquo;If I am going to shut you down, would you be seeing texts or would you be finding my people at your door ready to shut you down? So obviously there is no truth about the texts. But you need to convince your customers that I am not going to shut you down because if they believe that and come, I will have no choice but to come running and shut you down&rsquo;,&rdquo; Thuku recalled. He&nbsp;asked the governor then to send out a strong statement to counter the rumour, but Dr Njoroge advised against it.&nbsp;He&nbsp;had&nbsp;done that for Chase&nbsp;Bank&nbsp;and the next thing&nbsp;he&nbsp;knew, they were down.

He&nbsp;added that&nbsp;he&nbsp;knew&nbsp;he&nbsp;had&nbsp;to talk to customers and convince them not to&nbsp;withdraw&nbsp;their money. &ldquo;We did this for a whole week.&rdquo; The&nbsp;bank&nbsp;informed staff to calm depositors. They brought in the chairman of the board, Wilfred Kiboro, and started contacting depositors. &ldquo;Our phone batteries were dying. We&nbsp;had&nbsp;to recharge them to keep calling customers and tell them the rumours were not true,&rdquo; Thuku said. &ldquo;I spoke to a&nbsp;man&nbsp;who&nbsp;had&nbsp;about Sh40&nbsp;million&nbsp;in his account and&nbsp;he&nbsp;told me, &lsquo;Please, I have known you for 15&nbsp;years, tell me the truth. Is the&nbsp;bank&nbsp;closing down?&rsquo; &ldquo;I told him we are not going anywhere.&nbsp;He&nbsp;was under so much pressure because his wife was calling him constantly and telling him not to go home if&nbsp;he&nbsp;had&nbsp;not withdrawn their money. &ldquo;I told him, &lsquo;If you remove the money, you will actually make the&nbsp;bank&nbsp;collapse&rsquo;.&nbsp;He&nbsp;understood the logic, but his wife was telling him that if the money got lost ... Now you see how I was standing between a divorce.&rdquo; Thuku says the&nbsp;man&nbsp;went to his office and told him&nbsp;he&nbsp;had&nbsp;heard there was a crisis meeting the&nbsp;bank&nbsp;was having with the governor. &ldquo;He&nbsp;started assisting in calling other customers to tell them&nbsp;he&nbsp;is in the&nbsp;bank&nbsp;and everything is normal. So the connection with customers is very important,&rdquo; Thuku said. The&nbsp;bank&nbsp;put out press briefings to assure the market that things were fine. Thuku also went to&nbsp;Family&nbsp;Bank&nbsp;branches&nbsp;to help reassure staff and talk directly to customers and serve them as a teller.
