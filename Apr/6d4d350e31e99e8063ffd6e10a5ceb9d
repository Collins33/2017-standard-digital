A little over a week ago, Ruth Wangari left her four children in bed while she walked to a market near Kiserian town to buy vegetables. A little while later, a neighbour called her with the tragic news that the children had died in a fire that had engulfed her home. Apparently, Wangari had left some water boiling on a kerosene stove, which is suspected to have burst into flames that engulfed the house, burning the children to death. &ldquo;I feel as if life has become worthless. I have lost everything,&rdquo; she told The Standard shortly after the tragedy. Wangari is not the only parent to suffer such a loss caused by accidents that occur in the home.
