Nairobi County ODM primaries scheduled for Tuesday 25 April 2017 have been cancelled. &nbsp; The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party National Elections Board said the polls had to be called off due to &lsquo;unavoidable circumstances&rsquo;. Philip Etale, ODM communications director, said that the youth stormed the warehouse where election material had been stored complaining that the polls&nbsp;will not be free and fair.&nbsp; New dates will be announced later in the day.&nbsp;
