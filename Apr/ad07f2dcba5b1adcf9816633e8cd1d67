The Jubilee Party primaries in Isiolo will kick off today without the anticipated battle for the governor&rsquo;s ticket. According to County Election Board Chairman Abduba Sama, former Tana and Athi River Development Authority Chairman Abdul Bahari is the sole candidate for the governor&rsquo;s ticket. This followed the defection of Senator Mohammed Kuti to Narc Kenya last week, claiming JP headquarters was planned to rig him out. Incumbent Governor Godana Doyo had earlier shifted to the newly formed Party for Development and Unity (PDR). The Senate nomination has only attracted one candidate, former upper Eastern IEBC coordinator Mohammed Liban. His sole challenger, nominated senator Fatuma Dullo, defected to PDR.

According to Dr Sama, some aspirants defected long after the ballot papers had been printed. However, the most interesting battle will be for the woman representative, Isiolo North and Isiolo South parliamentary and 10 ward representative seats. The battle pits incumbent Woman Representative Tiyah Galgalo against her 2013 rival Rehema Dida. Ms Dida is the widow of former Moyale MP Guracha Galgalo, who died in a plane crash in Marsabit on April 10, 2005 and is the immediate former chairperson of the Kenya Industrial Estate.
