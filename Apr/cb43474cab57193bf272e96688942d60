Kenyan lender CBA Group has agreed to make a market for the country&#39;s debut mobile phone-based bond, guaranteeing investors an exit whenever they need it, officials said on Tuesday. Kenya raised 150 million shillings ($1.45 million) with the three-year bond, called M-Akiba, becoming the first in the world to issue a government bond exclusively via mobile phone. &quot;They (CBA) will be the buyer to every seller and a seller to every buyer,&quot; said Geoffrey Odundo, the chief executive of the Nairobi Securities Exchange. CBA&#39;s status as a market maker for the new bond followed negotiations with the government. Neither parties disclosed the costs of the provision of liquidity for the three-year life of the bond. CBA was the first to start offering saving and lending products on mobile phones. In 2012, it launched M-Shwari on the M-Pesa mobile cash platform, owned by telecoms operator Safaricom.

The second tranche of M-Akiba, worth 4.85 billion shillings is set to open in June and Wohoro Ndoho, the head of debt at the ministry of finance, said other mobile issues would follow. &quot;We do not envisage this as a one-off. This has to be a permanent part of our financial sector infrastructure to make sure the average Kenyan gets an opportunity to participate,&quot; Ndoho said at a bell ringing ceremony for the bond. About 108,000 Kenyans have registered on their mobile phones to invest in M-Akiba since last month, compared with just 20,000 existing retail investor accounts with the central bank for normal Treasury bonds, showing the potential for M-Akiba to help mobilise savings, Odundo said.
