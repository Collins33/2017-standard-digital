&nbsp; Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong ODM aspirants closed the Busia County party office over the weekend, saying the forthcoming nomination exercise will not be free and fair as some officials were too close to Governor Sospeter Ojaamong. Led by Marachi West MCA Patrick Gomba and Nambale MP hopeful Peter Odima, the aspirants said the county elections board should not be allowed to oversee the nominations. The aspirants are close allies of Funyula MP Paul Otuoma who will face Mr Ojaamong&#39; in the nominations. However, the governor clarified that a new county office had been set up in Nambale. Dr Otuoma accused Ojaamong of courting some members of the elections board to ensure an outcome that favours him.

Otuoma warned that should the nominations fail to be free and fair, he will not accept the results. &quot;Governor Ojaamong has been boasting that he already has the ticket. We are warning the elections board,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
