Eighteen aspirants for the Karachuonyo parliamentary seat return to the ballot today in a repeat nomination ordered by the ODM&rsquo;s National Elections Board. The board ordered the repeat after four of the aspirants claimed they had won the party ticket in the primaries held last Monday. Aspirants Adipo Okuome, Tom Dola and Dave Arunga presented results showing they were the winners. In a press statement yesterday, the party&rsquo;s elections board said the repeat nomination will also be held for four ward 6tickets -- Kibiri, North Karachuonyo, Wang&rsquo;chieng and West Karachuonyo. During the April 24 nominations, all presiding and returning officers went into hiding before announcing the official results.

Ondora garnered 7,753 votes, trouncing his sole challenger Phillip Maobe who got 5,858 votes, following a repeat nomination after it was cancelled last week. The nomination on April 18 had been cancelled because&nbsp; Maobe&rsquo;s name did not appear on the ballot papers. After the results were announced yesterday morning at Nyamarambe Town Hall, Ondora asked his rival Maobe to join him in the campaigns for NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka. &ldquo;It is now our duty to campaign for our presidential candidate Raila Odinga, Kisii Governor James Ongwae and all ODM candidates in Kisii County to ensure we have a government that is willing to serve Kenyans after the August General Election,&rdquo; said Ondora. In Bogetenga ward, Reuben Moreka clinched the ODM ticket, while Samuel Nyakangi and Joseph Makabe won in Chitago Borabu and Boikanga wards, respectively.
