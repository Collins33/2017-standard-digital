The Anglican Church of Kenya&#39;s Bondo diocese will Saturday meet to elect a new bishop. The church&#39;s electoral will pick one of three candidates to lead 20,000 faithful. Among those lined up is Rev Canon David Kodiah who is the acting Vice Chancellor&nbsp; of the Great Lakes&nbsp; University of&nbsp; Kisumu. Others are the current Diocesan Secretary George Omil and the Vicar General Paul Nehemiah Onyango. Friday, clergy from various parishes took to social media to rally support for their preferred candidate. Prof Kodiah studied theology at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, and then moved to Northwestern Christian University where he obtained a Masters degree in Theology and Doctor of Philosophy in Christian Theology. He has worked as a consultant for the Corporation of Research and Advisory Trust in Africa. Besides consulting as a trainer, Prof Kodiah has been involved in project evaluation, strategic planning, and conflict and peace resolution. He is the Clerical Secretary of the Anglican Church of Kenya as well as a member of the Board of Education and Training. The incumbent, Rt Rev Johanes Otieno Angela, was the first Bishop of Bondo Diocese after it was hived off the Anglican Diocese of Maseno West. This will be the second election since the diocese was established 18 years ago. ALSO READ: Tribunal disbands elections board over bias
