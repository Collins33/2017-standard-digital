Low cost airline Skyward Express Limited has expressed optimism that faster connectivity to the Lamu archipelago destination would boost the region&rsquo;s economy. The airline has introduced direct flights from Mombasa to Lamu. Speaking at the Pride Inn Paradise Beach Resort &amp; Convention Centre, on Friday, the firm&rsquo;s General Manager Mr Abdulahi Mohamed said they are committed to serving the business community and tourists alike. It has introduced a daily air service that originates from Nairobi&rsquo;s Wilson Airport. He said this during a dinner hosted for stakeholders in the tourism industry. &ldquo;This was a risk worth taking. Since our inaugural flight on March 31, 2017, we have been recording full flights on the route from Mombasa and vice versa,&rdquo; the GM said. Skyward Express Limited has deployed a Bombadier Dash 8-300 for the route. Mombasa Senator, Hassan Omar who was the chief guest at the function commended the owners for choosing to start the service.&nbsp;
