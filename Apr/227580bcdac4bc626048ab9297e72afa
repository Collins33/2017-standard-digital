Migori governor aspirant Ochillo Ayacko has obtained a&nbsp;court order blocking ODM nomination results. The order states that the results have been nullified and any further announcement is an act in futility.&nbsp; Ayacko approached the Appeals Tribunal claiming that the nominations were not being handled in a fair manner.&nbsp; Three returning officers and their deputies have also resigned. The officers are from Uriri, Suna West and Awendo constituencies. The Migori elections team is awaiting communication on their replacement.&nbsp;
