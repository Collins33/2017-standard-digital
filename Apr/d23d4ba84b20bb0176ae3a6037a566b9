&nbsp; Jamii Bora Bank PHOTO:COURTESY A former bank executive is now Sh38 million richer after a court ruled that he was unfairly sacked. Minnie Mbue, the former executive director of Jamii Bora Bank, was handed the award by the&nbsp;Court of Appeal, which increased the award from the initial Sh15 million given by the Employment and Labour Relations Court three years ago. The Appellate court found that the bank needed to pay her salary arrears for 44 months and at the same time pay gratuity and leave allowance. The manager was initially employed by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) as a manager in the banks supervision division before Jamii Bora poached her following the merger of City Finance Bank and Jamii Bora Micro Finance on a five-year contract. This was on April 15, 2010. However, in 2011, the bank decided to do away with her in a restructuring process on allegations that she performed poorly.
