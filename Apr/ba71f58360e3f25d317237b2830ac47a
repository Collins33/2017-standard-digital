Outa was the only contestant present at the county tallying centre but did not speak to the media after the announcement. Okong&#39;o who hastily announced the results was quickly whisked away from the venue into the waiting convoy and driven out of the compound. Earlier in the evening, Mr Okong&#39;o had threatened to pull out of the job after he claimed that Returning Officers had declined to count votes and relay to the county tallying centre while demanding to be paid their allowances. He said his two assistants had pulled out and disappeared, a situation which partly caused tension among aspirants. He did not however divulge much on how he changed his mind and got the results which he announced as provisional. ALSO READ: Raila allies face litmus test in battle for Nairobi
