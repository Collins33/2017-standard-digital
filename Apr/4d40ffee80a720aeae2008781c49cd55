1. Know your size and behave your size- if you are 150kgs then accept that&nbsp;fact&nbsp;and make sure your clothes reflect that. Some fat people like to dress&nbsp;according&nbsp;to the size they&nbsp;wish&nbsp;they were, instead of the size they really. Stuffing yourself into skinny jeans or constricting yourself into Spandex will not make you smaller- accept the reality in size. 2. Accept the&nbsp;fact&nbsp;that people will judge you and give you their opinions. Yes when we see fat people eating too much especially when they stock up on KFC and pizzas, we&nbsp;do&nbsp;give them bad stares and whisper behind their backs. So fat people either need to develop a thick skin to deal with the judgemental stares or to eat smaller portions when out in public. 3. If you have chosen to let your weight go,&nbsp;do&nbsp;not transfer the same issues to your children. The world of children is more cruel and unforgiving to fat children who get bullied and taunted for their weight. Fat children are usually excluded from fun stuff just because they have too many kilos- spare your children the misery.
