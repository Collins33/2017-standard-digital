Commercial office space continues to offer above average returns on investment, according to a new report by Cytonns Real Estate. The real estate firm&rsquo;s Chief Investments Officer Elizabeth Nkukuu said despite slight softening in the sector, the asset class has not registered improved returns on investment. &quot;In 2016, the average returns from the sector were over 20 per cent and the capital appreciation compared to the stock market that returned negative 8.5 per cent,&quot; she said. According to the report, increases in office space supply is constraining performance with occupancy rates and prices declining as rents and yields experience slower growth rates. &ldquo;The occupancy rates have remained fairly stable with a one per cent decline between 2015 and 2016 while the asking prices declined by 5.8 per cent,&rdquo; said Ms Nkuku.
