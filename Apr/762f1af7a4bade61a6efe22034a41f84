Wiper supremo Kalonzo Musyoka will not bolt out of the National Super Alliance (NASA), a leader in the super alliance Musalia Mudavadi has assured. Mudavadi, who is the Amani National Congress leader, said NASA principals had held a meeting recently where Kalonzo had stated unequivocally that he would remain in the super alliance. Mudavadi said that during this meeting, Kalonzo joined Farah Maalim and other party honchos in distancing themselves from ultimatums issued by National Assembly Minority Leader Francis Nyenze. &ldquo;Kalonzo has disowned outbursts from Nyenze and assured us when we held a meeting over the same that he is in NASA regardless,&rdquo; Mudavadi said. Mudavadi was speaking in Migori County on Friday where he met members of the Maragoli community and aspirants who want to vie for seats on an ANC ticket. When he was asked why NASA was taking too long to name a flag bearer, Mudavadi said the process was painstaking to ensure there were no loopholes to be exploited by their rivals. &ldquo;We must be careful to ensure our lineup is viable and can oust the ruling Jubilee coalition,&rdquo; he said.
