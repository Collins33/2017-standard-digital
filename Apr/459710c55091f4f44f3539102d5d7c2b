Once held in awe for its wildlife, cool weather and unique architecture, Nairobi is today groaning under garbage. In fact, gubernatorial aspirant Peter Kenneth calls it &ldquo;Capital City of Garbage in Africa&rdquo;. The pungent smell from burst sewers, putrid used diaper, stagnant waters and garbage are unsettling Nairobians. And Nairobi central business district entrepreneurs have added their voice to the uproar on the filth choking the city county. They want Governor Evans Kidero to take action against city askaris, whom they blame for the city filth. &ldquo;They regularly demand fees for garbage collection, but when it&rsquo;s time to pick up the trash, they disappear. We are forced to pay other private companies to do it,&rdquo; said Peter Maina, a trader. They lamented about the implications of working in unhygienic conditions, arguing that their income was rapidly dwindling with increased dirt around their working areas. The customers, who fear for their health, shun them. &ldquo;I have a recurring cold because of this filth, and it is already infecting my clients. Areas such as Mwawero, Nyamakima and Gikomba markets are unsightly and inhabitable and there is dire need to act quickly to resolve this,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Nairobi County unveils Sh1.5b budget
