NAIROBI, KENYA: Why is President Uhuru Kenyatta jumping the gun by announcing an increment of salaries for the lowly paid Kenyan workers, which he says he will make public on May 1, during the Labour Day celebrations? What is the urgency in making the announcement given that the Big Day is just around the corner? Or maybe the president wants the affected workers to applaud doubly?
