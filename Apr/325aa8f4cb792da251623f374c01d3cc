An aspirant for Mathare Member of the County Assembly has been arrested after he allegedly fired his gun in chaotic campaigns. Geoffrey Okuto Otieno was campaigning in the area on Sunday when his group clashed with his opponent&#39;s supporters. The man, who is a licensed firearm holder, is alleged to have whipped out his pistol and shot in the air to disperse the fighting group before police arrived there. Nairobi police boss Japheth Koome said Otieno would be charged with misusing his gun. &quot;It was not necessary for him to shoot at that point,&quot; he said.

One person was killed last month when supporters of nominated senator Elizabeth Ongoro and those of Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang clashed. Ruaraka is one of the hot spots in Nairobi where police say they will deploy heavily ahead of the August 8 general elections.
