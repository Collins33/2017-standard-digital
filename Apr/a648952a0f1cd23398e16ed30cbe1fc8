Nairobi Woman Representative Rachel Shebesh Thursday said the Jubilee Party Nairobi team was consumed by unbridled ambition and pride, and refused to compromise even after a request by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Ms Shebesh, who was speaking at Kasarani, said they were asked to devise a plan that would see Jubilee front leaders from various ethnic groups but she was the only one willing to step aside. &ldquo;We were trying to find a formula in Nairobi that works for everyone and that formula would include all tribes. However, that did not work because of people&rsquo;s pride,&rdquo; she said. Shebesh said although she was still committed to the plan and was more than happy to step aside, she would now defend her seat in the county. &ldquo;When everyone failed to agree on the matter, we decided that we would all go for the nominations and see who comes out on top,&rdquo; she said, confidently declaring that none of her competitors could match her. &ldquo;I respect those young girls (aspirants) but they have quite some time to catch up with me, she said.
