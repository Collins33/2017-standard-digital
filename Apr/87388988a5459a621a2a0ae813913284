The High Court in Nakuru has barred the Government from disbursing Sh6 billion set aside for resettlement and compensation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). In a ruling issued on Tuesday, judge Janet Mulwa allowed the application by Internally Displaced Persons Support Initiative (IDPSI) and certified it urgent. She further issued a temporary injunction preventing the Government through the Ministry of Devolution from releasing the funds until the matter is fully heard and determined. Justice Mulwa noted the application before her was of public interest and ought to be handled in a just and fair manner. &ldquo;The application is certified urgent and temporary injunction orders prohibiting the respondents (Principal Secretary Ministry of Devolution and Planning, Principal Secretary Ministry of Interior and Co-ordination of National Government and the Attorney General) in the suit from paying out the Sh6 billion set aside by the Government issued until the suit is heard and determined fully,&rdquo; said Justice Mulwa. Through their lawyer, Wilfred Konosi, the IDPs submitted that those in the list to be paid are not genuine IDPs.
