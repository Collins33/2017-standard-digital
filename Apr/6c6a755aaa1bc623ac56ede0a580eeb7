Do you have a happy corner? That is what I call my little hideout where I run to when life throws lemons my way. In every house I live in, I make an effort to have a little corner that brings me nothing but happiness. It needs not be expensive but it ought to be cosy and should have items that bring a smile to your face. A book &mdash; or shall I say books &mdash; is a must-have for my happy corner, but find your own happy items, which can be placed in your happy corner like photography gallery of your family and friends, your child&rsquo;s artwork or a painting that takes you back in time. Create a flashback theme of technology from another era such as a typewriter, an old telephone set and an old camera. The happy corner can have two comfortable wing chairs that are placed in symmetry and which have a table that snuggles right into a corner and takes the least space possible. Include a table lamp to illuminate your &ldquo;happy items&rdquo; or a floor lamp that helps you read. A vase of flowers or potted plants are a great source of creating calmness and pleasantness. For many children, room corners are often associated with naughtiness. Reverse this trend by encouraging children and teenagers to have a happy reading corner, perhaps in their bedroom or study room, where you place a whimsical child-friendly seat or a bean bag seat with a shelf full of their favourite books.
