A professor who is seeking to unseat Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma on an ODM ticket says county governments have failed to achieve their development goals due to lack of an integrated development master plan. Gordon Wayumba, a geospatial science expert, says Kisumu has been dishing out projects based on political considerations and not according people&#39;s needs. &quot;We have cases where government built dispensaries in ares which already have these facilities and fails to consider areas where these facilities are needed. Such problems can be addressed through proper mapping of the county and preparation of an Integrated Development Master plan which I will use if elected,&quot; said&nbsp; Wayumba. Wayumba, a former director of School of Surveying and Geospatial Sciences at Technical, says he will tackle unemployment and lack of land for new investments. &quot;One of my plans is to set up a land bank which will help us secure large tracks of land for development.&quot; he said.
