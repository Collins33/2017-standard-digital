A plant for collection of rabbit urine for production of organic fertiliser has been commissioned at Kegoye Secondary School. The project by the national government under the Affirmative Action Fund will help small-scale farmers rearing rabbits to benefit from the sale of the urine. It targets groups of farmers who have in the past tried keeping rabbits and failed to benefit from them due to poor market structures. Senior Assistant Director of Agriculture in the Ministry of Agriculture Philip Makheti said the idea was well timed. &quot;Few people think of utilising the rabbit&#39;s urine. Many people often think of the rabbit&#39;s meat, and then life ends at that. We need to think further of new solutions and ways of adding value to whatever we have in our farms,&quot; Makheti said. He said the market has a scarcity of organic fertiliser, and the addition of the rabbit&#39;s urine extra organic liquid manure will help farmers reduce over-reliance on inorganic fertilisers.
