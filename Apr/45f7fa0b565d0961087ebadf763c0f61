ODM&#39;s National Elections Board (NEB) has changed features on ballot papers, to make them different from those used earlier in Kakamega, Busia and Kisii counties to forestall rigging. The change was made after it emerged that some aspirants were purportedly reprinting the ballot papers. Thursday, The Standard established that NEB Chair Judy Pareno telephoned some of the aspirants in the race and confirmed to them that all was well. She also reportedly assured aspirants that all of them had an equal chance of winning and that none of them would be favoured, irrespective of their proximity to the party ranks and file. She also warned of possible disqualification of those found culpable or in breach of the electoral code of conduct to cause violence.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Human rights body seeks clarity on standards of integrity
