NAIROBI, KENYA: A new report by financial services firm EY has painted a grim picture on how youthful employees are likely to embrace bad business practices to achieve profits. The report titled, Human instinct or machine logic &ndash; which do you trust most in the fight against fraud and corruption? Says that millennials &ndash; youthful employees aged between 25 to 34 years &ndash; believe that the kind of management style they would embrace, would include offering illegal cash payments to win business deals. &quot;Millennials who constitute 32 per cent of overall respondents, demonstrate more relaxed attitudes toward unethical behavior,&quot; the report notes. &quot;Seventy-three percent of this state that such behaviour is justified to help a business survive, compared to 49 per cent of 45 to 54 year olds (Generation X) surveyed who hold this view,&quot; it continues. Dennis Muchiri, East Africa Fraud Investigation &amp; Dispute Services Leader at EY said that millennials show a heightened distrust of their co-workers, with 49 per cent believing that their colleagues would be prepared to act unethically to improve their own career progression, compared with 40 per cent across all age groups.
