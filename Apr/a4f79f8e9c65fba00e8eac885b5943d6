&nbsp;Purple is often associated with royalty, but how you pair it in your interiors will make or break your decor. When working with this colour, I always find that I have to be double careful about hue intensities and observe the amount of lighting that filters into a room. It works well in a room with a lot of lighting, but pairing it with green breaths garden-like ambience into the room. Here is how to get the look in the photograph illustrated in this article which is designed by Wilmer Furnishings who also provided the furniture and furnishing: Bed arrangement Get a well-tailored bedspread in purple fabric that will adequately cover the bed. The sides of the bed cover should preferably drop to cover the sides of the bed. A good headboard will always give you mileage to make the bed stand out in a room. Need I say that the mattress should be firm to avoid the bed looking like it is sagging, not to mention that a sagging mattress is bad for your back. Place a bed runner in complementary colours over the bedspread. This is an optional dressing for your bed that gives the bed a hotel-like appearance. The bed runner should be aligned to the drop length of the bedcover. Bed side table lampshades provide balance in the room and help to anchor the primary purple colour from the bedspread. Twin seat To increase utility of a room requires multi-purpose furniture as shown. Use the seat to chat with a spouse or to provide a reading corner to curl up and get engrossed in a book. The green colour used on the seat matches the green colour on the curtains and one set of pillows. The seat has aesthetically functional scatter cushions in colours that complement the room&rsquo;s colour scheme so a touch of green and pink cushions punctuated by a floral cushion connects with the floral pattern on the window sheer and one of the pillow sets.&nbsp;
