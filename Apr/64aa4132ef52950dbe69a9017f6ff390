Leaders and victors in the ongoing ODM nominations have pleaded with the losers not to leave the party. Instead, they want those who lost to support the winners to give the party a chance to prepare for the August 8 elections. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, who is also the ODM deputy party leader, joined the aspirants who won in the just-concluded primaries in the county in appealing to legislators and MCAs who have been edged out to stick with the party. Oparanya argued that the process was credible compared to past nominations.
