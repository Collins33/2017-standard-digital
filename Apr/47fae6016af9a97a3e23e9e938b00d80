The owners of 45,000 prime land have lost a bid to lock out&nbsp;KenGen from setting up a Sh6.9 billion wind farm. Lands and Environment Judge Ann Mbugua declined to lift the previous orders terminating land demarcation. The&nbsp;9,000 land owners, trough lawyers Kaume Mukira and Rodgers Rutugua from Tigania East wanted the court to quash an order issued after Meru Governor Peter Munya filed a petition seeking to stop demarcation process. &quot;The governor alleges that the parcel is a trust land yet there are genuine owners,&quot; Mr Kaume said. The case will be mentioned on May 9.
