Bomet Governor and NASA co-principal Isaac Ruto has pledged to deliver more than one million votes to the Opposition in the August elections. Speaking on a vernacular radio station, Radio Mayienga, yesterday morning, Ruto said the campaign to unseat President Uhuru Kenyatta was unstoppable and he was sure of bringing between one and 1.5 million voters from his community. He said many members of his community were yearning for change and assured&nbsp;Raila&nbsp;that he will get massive support from them, unlike in 2013 when they voted overwhelmingly for Jubilee. The governor also challenged Luo leaders to change their tacK in conflict resolution and avoid sporadic political violence if they want&nbsp;Raila&nbsp;to win the Presidency. The Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) leader said he was surprised to hear some voters from Nyanze threatening not to vote in the August polls because aspirants of their choice did not win the nominations.

He said the killing of Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo&rsquo;s bodyguard and torching of her house shocked many. &ldquo;We must stop this cycle of violence and the belief that every difference must be sorted with violence,&rdquo; he said in the 10-minute interview. Ruto said he fully supported the decision to pick&nbsp;Raila&nbsp;as the opposition flag bearer, adding that the former Prime Minister was the best bet given his experience and long struggle for democracy in Kenya. &ldquo;We must appreciate the Odinga family. They have sacrificed their lives to bring democracy and fairness to this country. It started with&nbsp;Raila&rsquo;s&nbsp;father,&nbsp; Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. We must celebrate this family,&rdquo; said&nbsp; Governor Ruto. He said a NASA government will ensure devolution works. &ldquo;Under a NASA government, remittances to the counties will hit 45 per cent from the current 15,&rdquo; he said.
