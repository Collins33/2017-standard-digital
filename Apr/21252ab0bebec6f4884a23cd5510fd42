Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama has been questioned by senators over Sh6 million collected by the county but not declared in its books. A report by Auditor General Edward Ouko noted that the revenue was not included in the financial statements, leading to material misstatement of the financial liabilities of the devolved unit. This, according to the audit report, made it hard to confirm if the statements for the 2014-2015 financial year were accurate. The Senate&rsquo;s Public Investment and Accounts Committee Tuesday directed Mr Ouko to carry out investigations into how the Sh6 million that was not disclosed in the county government&rsquo;s financial statements was spent. According to the Audit report, the county&rsquo;s financial statements reflected nil balances under deposits and retentions&rsquo; accounts. However, the bank statements produced indicated that Sh6,065,548 was under the Nyamira County Project Retention Account at the Cooperative Bank Ltd.

Mr Nyangarama said the amount was being held in retention for contractors and that was reason it was not reflected in the financial statements.
