Grief has gripped a village in Nambale Constituency following the death of three members of the same family who were struck by lightning. A man, his wife and their four-month baby died on the spot in Tatira village on Saturday. The bodies were taken to Kocholia District Hospital mortuary. Their relatives are now appealing for help to bury them. The area has been experiencing heavy rainfall accompanied by thunderstorm for the past one week. Aluku Isi, a brother to the dead man, said they were unable to raise the mortuary fees and could not afford coffins. &quot;We are unable to give them a decent send-off due to financial constraints,&quot; Isi said yesterday.
