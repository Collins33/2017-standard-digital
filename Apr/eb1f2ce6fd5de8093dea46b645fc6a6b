NAIROBI: Jubilee&nbsp;secretariat&nbsp;officials&nbsp;fired&nbsp;over&nbsp;party&nbsp;ticket&nbsp;scam&nbsp;are&nbsp;now&nbsp;blaming&nbsp;their&nbsp;exit&nbsp;on a&nbsp;high-stakes&nbsp;scramble&nbsp;for&nbsp;Sh300&nbsp;million&nbsp;ballots&nbsp;printing&nbsp;tender.&nbsp;Colleagues&nbsp;of the&nbsp;sacked&nbsp;seven&nbsp;who&nbsp;spoke&nbsp;to&nbsp;The Sunday Standard&nbsp;attributed the axing to a clash among two camps slogging it out for the&nbsp;printing&nbsp;job. A few others attributed it to a botched gerrymandering of a key gubernatorial contest in President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s backyard. The&nbsp;party&nbsp;will be&nbsp;printing&nbsp;nomination&nbsp;ballots&nbsp;for 8,012 aspirants - 106 governors, 161 senators, 171 women representatives, 1,006 members of national assembly and 6,568 members of county assemblies. &ldquo;I can tell you all this is contrived, including the stories said about it. The fact of the matter is that this team was a victim of selfish agenda of some of our bosses. People do not want to believe that they will not get a slice of the&nbsp;ballot&nbsp;tender,&rdquo; a source at&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;headquarters told The Sunday Standard. One camp is said to comprise of three top&nbsp;secretariat&nbsp;officials&nbsp;- a man and two women - while the other is comprised of election board&nbsp;officials&nbsp;keen to stamp their authority as ultimate authority on&nbsp;party&nbsp;primaries. The mistake the&nbsp;sacked&nbsp;team did, their&nbsp;colleagues&nbsp;say, was to bypass the three&nbsp;secretariat&nbsp;officials&nbsp;in handing&nbsp;over&nbsp;aspirants bio-data to the elections board for purposes of preparing the&nbsp;ballots. All the&nbsp;sacked&nbsp;officials&nbsp;were said to have been close to ex-party&nbsp;Secretary General Veronica Maina who&nbsp;was quietly hounded out on discreet allegations of partisanship in the key gubernatorial contest among others issues.

When former executive director Raphael Tuju&nbsp;exited&nbsp;the seat and former electoral commissioner Winnie Guchu took&nbsp;over, two more IT experts came on board to take&nbsp;over&nbsp;preparation of the aspirants list. &ldquo;We continued with the verification but once we handed&nbsp;over&nbsp;everything, they decided to chase us away,&rdquo; one of the&nbsp;sacked&nbsp;officials&nbsp;said.&nbsp;
