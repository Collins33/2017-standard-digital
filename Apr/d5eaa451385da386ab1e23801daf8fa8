Honda Kenya is set to spread its wings to Burundi&rsquo;s capital, Bujumbura. The firm&rsquo;s Chairman Dr Isaac Kalua said the firm had already clinched a dealership agreement with Burundi&rsquo;s Old East Company, which has already opened a motorcycle shop in Bujumbura. He spoke when he hosted Burundian Vice President Gaston Sindimwo for a tour of Honda&rsquo;s plant in Industrial Area in Nairobi Wednesday. The VP said there were few motorcycles in Burundi yet the industry had great potential in the landlocked country. &ldquo;We are looking for quality. We have come to learn and to see how Burundi can have a plant like this one,&rdquo; he said. Mr Sindmwo said the expansion of motorcycle business in Burundi would create jobs for the youth and in turn curb insecurity in the volatile nation. The vice president&rsquo;s visit was a precursor to boosting business in Burundi as well as a gesture of goodwill between the two countries. The VP also toured the Honda vehicle outlet and service centre on Mombasa Road where it was revealed the firm would soon start selling vehicles to Burundi.
