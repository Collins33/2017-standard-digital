It may sound like something out of a Westworld TV script, but sex robots with customisable nipples that can quote Shakespeare could soon be replacing women in the bedroom. California-based Abyss Creations is building a range of silicone sex dolls that not only look like real women but move and speak like them too. The dolls are fully customisable, from their eyes and hair to their breasts and genitalia. There are 14 different styles of labia and 42 different nipple options. They can even be made in the image of real people. Some customers reportedly send in pictures, or even bring their wives or girlfriends to the workshop to get exact replicas made. An app called Harmony 2.0 allows the user to tailor their RealDoll&#39;s &quot;personality&quot; by selecting from 18 traits - including happy, shy, sensual, funny, jealous, moody and talkative. Turn up the intellectual setting and it may even recite poetry or engage in witty banter. &quot;The AI will learn through interaction, and not just learn about you, but learn about the world in general,&quot; RealDolls creator, Matt McMullen, told The Guardian. &quot;You can explain certain facts to her, she will remember them and they will become part of her base knowledge.&quot; Abyss is not the only company developing sex robots. The sex tech industry is already estimated to be worth $30 billion, and sex robots are expected to be the next big craze. While some suggest they could replace prostitutes, others see them as potential companions for people who are socially isolated or struggle to form human relationships. &quot;This isn&#39;t designed to distort someone&#39;s reality to the point where they start interacting with humans the way they do with the robot,&quot; said McMullen. &quot;This is for the gentle people who have such a hard time connecting with other people.&quot;
