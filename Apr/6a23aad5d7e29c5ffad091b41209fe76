A section of Western Kenya leaders have differed over the National Super Alliance (NASA) line-up. Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe has dismissed the alliance saying the community has been shortchanged. &ldquo;NASA line-up is a blackmail, abuse and disguise to the community. The premier Cabinet Secretary is not in the Constitution and I do not think if NASA will agree to spend Sh10 billion of a referendum to create the slots,&rdquo; said Wangwe. He said the community should vote for Jubilee government, saying President Uhuru Kenyatta has initiated a lot of projects in the region compared to other governments since independence. However, political analyst and scholar, Amukowa Anangwe said NASA team is more inclusive compared to Jubilee administration, which according to him, remains essentially a two-man show featuring President Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.
