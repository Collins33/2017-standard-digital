[PHOTO:BONIFACE OKENDO/Standard] Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has claimed that there are plans to cause chaos during the Jubilee Party primaries scheduled for Friday. Mr Kamau who is vying for the gubernatorial seat said he was privy to information that some youths have been hired to paralyse the nominations with a motive to ensure the elections are not free and fair. Addressing residents of Kenyatta Farm in Kihiu-Muiri in Gatanga during a rally, Kamau said the intention of the planned chaos is to tarnish his reputation since those hired to cause the chaos are required to wear t-shirts emblazoned with his name. &ldquo;I want to tell the people of Murang&rsquo;a that I am a peace loving leader who will not accept anyone to disrupt the nomination exercise through violence. I am privy to information that some people are planning to cause chaos in my name,&rdquo; said Kamau. The MP further alleged that the chaos are to be staged in areas where he has big support. He called on the county security team to investigate the matter and ensure nothing of the sort happens.
