Tatu City is launching the third phase of its &ldquo;Buy and Build&rdquo; residential project, Kijani Ridge. Located within the larger Tatu City, the new phase of the project introduces an additional 100 quarter-acre plots to meet demand as early phases sell out. Speaking at the recent Tatu City&rsquo;s Open Day, Nick Langford, Kenya country head for Rendeavour, Tatu City&rsquo;s majority owner and developer, said they had seen increased uptake at Kijani Ridge. &ldquo;We are helping many Kenyan families achieve their dreams at Tatu City by offering no reservation charges for booking and introducing mortgage providers that have pre-qualified Kijani Ridge plots for lending&rdquo;, he said. It will offer amenities, including a club house and restaurant, a school, a mini-shopping centre, a jogging track, a dam and natural green open space. The open day attracted more than 500 people. &ldquo;I am convinced that this is a worthwhile investment for my family. The plan put together and the thought process behind this is certainly admirable,&rdquo; said Edward Muchangi, one of the attendees.
