Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) traders encountered a tough terrain in 2016, with stockbrokers and investment banks recording losses or drop in returns. An analysis of the 22 active participants at the bourse and other investment banks shows that the market bear run swept away profits of most firms, leading to a combined loss. For new entrant Barclays Finance Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Barclays Bank of Kenya, its first year on the exchange began with a loss of Sh10.81 million. In a year that market capitalisation - a product of share price and number of listed shares - shrunk to Sh1.96 trillion from Sh2.05 trillion in 2015, leading traders also had it rough in making money. Prominent firms including Old Mutual Securities, SBG Securities, Kingdom Securities, AIB Capital and Sterling Capital posted negative returns. Also in loss-making zone was Apex Africa Capital, Genghis Capital and KCB Capital.
