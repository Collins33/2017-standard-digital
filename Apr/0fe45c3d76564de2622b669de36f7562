The Jubilee Party has pushed Bomet County nominations from Friday April 21 to Tuesday April 25 over what aspirants termed as shoddy preparations. Gubernatorial aspirant Joyce Laboso said there were challenges including delivery of few voting materials as well as missing names of some aspirants from the ballot papers. &ldquo;We are anticipating a turnout of more than 70% in the nominations, so the few ballots are a challenge,&rdquo; said Laboso. Before the announcement was made, the aspirants were holed up in a crisis meeting to forge the way forward after discovering that only half of the required ballot papers had been delivered. Bomet is among the Jubilee strongholds that were scheduled to hold Jubilee primaries on April 21.
