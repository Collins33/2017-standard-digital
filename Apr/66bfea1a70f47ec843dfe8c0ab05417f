ATHENS: Greece&#39;s coastguard said on Saturday that it had uncovered an international ring that transported large quantities of drugs from Albania to Italy using high-speed boats. The coastguard&#39;s drug-fighting unit said it had arrested five Albanians and two Greeks and seized 1.5 tonnes of unprocessed cannabis and two speedboats, estimating that the ring had made &quot;many millions of euros&quot;. The months-long investigation, in cooperation with Italy&#39;s Guardia di Finanza, found that the ring purchased large volumes of drugs in Albania and transported then on customized high-speed vessels to the shores of Italy, the Greek coastguard said.
