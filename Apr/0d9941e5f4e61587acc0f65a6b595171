Taita Taveta MP Naomi Shaban has made a U turn, days after quitting Jubilee Party over alleged frustrations. Shaban will thus take part in Jubilee Party primaries slated for April 21 where she will face youthful politician Mike Banton for the parliamentary seat. A close ally said Shaban and the Jubilee Party leadership reached a decision after fruitful consultations Monday. In a letter dated April 8, Shaban had announced her departure from the party but had not indicated where she was planning to set camp.
