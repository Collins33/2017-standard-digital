NAIROBI, KENYA: Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett has told students graduating in agricultural courses not to expect to be absorbed by the Government. Mr Bett explained that the Government had no capacity to employ agriculture technicians and managers even with the high number of students graduating every year. Instead, he advised graduates to be creative and innovative to be able to create jobs for themselves and others instead of wasting their time waiting for white-collar jobs. He was speaking during a graduation ceremony at Bukura Agricultural College. He said a new agriculture transformation and growth strategy designed to attract the youth into farming would be launched soon. &ldquo;The new strategy is focused on facilitating the youth to ensure they take agriculture to the next level and will replace the current development strategy, which has been in operation for a long time,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; He said they had identified several partners including the Government of India to transform the sector through modern farming technologies.
