Artists&nbsp;are&nbsp;championing&nbsp;a&nbsp;peace&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;through&nbsp;a&nbsp;documentary&nbsp;to&nbsp;ensure&nbsp;relative&nbsp;tranquillity&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;August&nbsp;8&nbsp;elections. Ken Wakia, Bud Simson and Dr Kevin Fenton of Festival Singers of Florida, are spreading the message of&nbsp;peace&nbsp;through&nbsp;a 45-minute&nbsp;documentary&nbsp;titled, A Voice For&nbsp;Peace. The&nbsp;documentary&nbsp;is based on the international&nbsp;peace&nbsp;day celebrated by having choirs across the globe singing Zulu Ukuthula. &ldquo;Ukuthula kulo mhlaba wezono (Aleluya) igazi lika Jesu linyenyez&rsquo; ukuthula,&rdquo; (Peace&nbsp;in this world of sin, the blood of Jesus brings&nbsp;peace), goes the song. Other than Ukhuthula there are other songs including Baba Yetu, Kayuocha, Ashe Naleng&rsquo; among others. But it is the idea to have this in a&nbsp;documentary&nbsp;shot by Simpson with locations in Maasai Mara, the US and other parts of the world that makes it unique. &ldquo;Kenya has been a force of&nbsp;peace&nbsp;and stability but it also has different challenges,&rdquo; says Ambassador Robert Godec in the&nbsp;documentary. Godec warns that competition between different ethnic groups is a recipe for chaos citing the 2007\08 post&nbsp;election&nbsp;violence.

In the&nbsp;documentary&nbsp;launched on Tuesday, Ms Obadha asks Kenyans to be like the wild animals that have the greatest ensemble ever and live together in harmony in nature. &ldquo;When you wake up in the morning here in the Mara you hear a lion roaring, the hyena laughing and the birds chirping in a sequential harmony,&rdquo; she observes. Yet the most touching part of the&nbsp;documentary&nbsp;is at Kakuma refugee camp where Mr Wakia who is a renown choral music conductor and the founder of the Nairobi Chamber Chorus has a time with the refugees from South Sudan to sing Ukuthula. He asks the refugees what the word&nbsp;peace&nbsp;means and they say stability, joy and love. &ldquo;Every human is the same at heart. The answers are exactly what I will get anywhere in the world,&rdquo; he says. One of the South Sudan refugees, Theresa says Kakuma is a&nbsp;peaceful&nbsp;place and for them it is a home not a camp.

When I sing Ukuthula it empowers me to sing and give a voice to spread thee message of&nbsp;peace,&rdquo; says another refugee Okello. United Nations High Commission for Refugees Country Representative, Raof Mazou notes that when ever you hear a song from another community there is always a positive effect to it. Joining the global voices&nbsp;championing&nbsp;peace&nbsp;in the&nbsp;documentary&nbsp;are the pupils from Magoso Primary School in Kibera, Nairobi. It is their music that gives credence to Amb Godec&rsquo;s words in the&nbsp;documentary, &ldquo;If we see what goes on in the world we need music now than ever before. I have never thought of a better way to heal the World except&nbsp;through&nbsp;music.&rdquo; The envoy says when all of us look across the world we see the reality of violence, the hurt, the suffering and it&#39;s form in different things. &quot;It&#39;s from war, from terrorism. Music is an international language and is a language of the heart and the soul. It can build bridges,&quot; he says. The&nbsp;documentary&nbsp;was launched this week at the US Embassy.
