A driver was killed and three people were seriously injured after a bus they were travelling in was involved in a grisly accident at Kwa Chocha area near Malindi town on Wednesday night. Confirming the incident Malindi Officer Commanding Police Division (OCPD) Matawa Muchangi said the Modern Coast bus KCF 614 U carrying 45 passengers had left Malindi town for Nairobi at around 8:30 pm but the driver seemed to have been late and was over speeding. &quot;The driver of the bus died on the spot after the bus rammed into a stagnant lorry when efforts to apply emergency brakes failed due to over speeding,&quot; said Muchangi. The injured passengers including a minor were rushed to the Malindi Sub County hospital while the body of the bus driver was taken at the Malindi mortuary. &quot;There was an accident earlier where the lorry had hit a tuk tuk and they were waiting for the traffic police to arrive when the second accident happened,&quot; he added.
