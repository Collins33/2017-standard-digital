Incidents of political intolerance have increased in Nakuru County ahead of party nominations.

He sustained neck injuries and reported the incident at the Nakuru Central Police Station (OB number 84/2/4/2017). Narrating his ordeal to The Standard at his house in Section 58 estate, the official claimed his assailants were members of a group of criminals who attack individuals who seem to have a different political opinion.
