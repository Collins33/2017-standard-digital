Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma and Senator Anyang&#39; Nyong&#39;o are locked in a war of words over claims that the ODM elections board is partisan. Ranguma claimed that the officials are likely to favour Nyong&#39;o, who is seeking to unseat him. However, the senator and his allies denied the claims and accused the governor&#39;s camp of trying to tarnish the party&#39;s name.&nbsp; The governor claimed that the officials have links with the senator and his allies, including Nyando MP Fred Outa, who is hoping to succeed Nyong&#39;o in the Senate. However, Nyong&#39;o denied the allegations saying his rival has resorted to spreading rumours after sensing defeat ahead of the party primaries.&nbsp; Speaking in Kajulu, Nyong&#39;o and Outa told off their opponents, maintaining that the referees are competent. &quot;It will be the electorate that will decide their fate and not the elections board,&quot; said Outa. Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga said&nbsp;she sees nothing wrong with the elections board and accused some aspirants of tarnishing the name of ODM and its leader, Raila Odinga. Former TNA secretary-general Onyango Oloo also defended the board. ALSO READ: NASA to announce own results &ndash; Raila Odinga
