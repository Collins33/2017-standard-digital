Kirinyaga gubernatorial aspirant Anne Waiguru has asked Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua to retire from active politics. Ms Waiguru said Karua had been Gichugu MP for four consecutive terms and that was enough service to area residents. Speaking at Karua&rsquo;s Kimunye village backyard during her Jubilee nomination campaigns, Waiguru said the county required a totally new crop of leadership to prosper. &quot;Leading Gichugu as its MP for 20 uninterrupted years and having been the minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs during president Kibaki&rsquo;s tenure, was no mean achievement and time is now ripe for her to retire,&quot; she said. Waiguru further claimed Karua was among the politicians who fixed Uhuru Kenyatta to face the ICC trial. &quot;It is therefore hypocritical for Karua to align herself with the winning Jubilee team whose leader is none other than the one she wanted jailed over alleged crimes against humanity,&quot; she claimed.
