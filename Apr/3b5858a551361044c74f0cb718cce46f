NAIROBI, KENYA: Safaricom has rewarded its customers with free M-pesa service following outage that crippled most of its services on Monday. The Company Chief Executive Officer Bob Collymore said as a small gesture, from midnight Tuesday to midnight Wednesday, all customers will be able to send money on the M-PESA network for free. It reported that the Monday system outage affected a number of core services. &ldquo;We had two&nbsp;traffic outlets which&nbsp;failed rapidly one after the other. In response, as a priority, the team very quickly started operating the affected functions from our redundant equipment in order to restore services,&rdquo; said Collymore. &ldquo;Although most customers could call, text and use data by noon and M-PESA by late afternoon yesterday, this work came to an end this morning. We are now working to ensure that network stability continues.&rdquo;
