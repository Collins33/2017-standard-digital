A 24-year-old woman died and also lost her unborn child while giving birth at Embu County Teaching and Referral Hospital on Monday night. The family of Mary Wanja from Gakwegori in Embu West sub-county has accused the hospital of neglect and wanted action taken against the doctor and other medical staff on duty that day. The family alleged that the woman arrived at the facility at 10am in labour but doctors declined to admit her until she bled and became unconscious at 4pm. The victim&#39;s mother Grace Wanja blamed the hospital for the death of her daughter. &quot;Why did the doctors watch from a distance as a pregnant woman struggled in pain waiting to be taken to theatre? This despite paying her NHIF fee every month,&quot; she said. Pauline Murugi, a sister of the victim, said they begged the doctors to admit her in vain.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Marsabit clans back ex-NHIF boss Muhamud Ali for governor
