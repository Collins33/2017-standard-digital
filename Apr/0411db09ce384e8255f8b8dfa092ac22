Weru, 36, passed away Monday morning in Nairobi. He was receiving treatment at the Intensive Care Unit at Ladnan Hospital when he developed breathing complications and efforts to resuscitate him failed. The journalist was admitted to hospital two ago weeks after being taken ill immediately after returning from Israel where he was attending a conference. At Avenue Hospital, where he was initially hospitalised, his condition slightly improved before it took a turn for the worse three days ago when he was moved to the ICU. Throughout his time in hospital, his family friends and colleagues have been at his side and his death comes as a shock to many. Following his death, there has been an outpouring of grief and tributes on social media from friends, colleagues and leaders.
