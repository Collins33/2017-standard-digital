ODM aspirants who lost in the recent nominations are demanding a repeat of the exercise, citing rigging and voter transportation. Some of them have threatened to go to court to challenge the exercise. Robert Lemerketo who lost to Lenas Leshore in the Samburu East parliamentary race said he would request the ODM elections board to cancel the results and organise a repeat. Mr Leshore got 977 votes against Mr Lemerketo&#39;s 320 votes. Lemerketo said the exercise was not free and fair arguing that some polling stations opened at 3pm. &quot;I will personally protest and complain to the office. I will ask them to repeat the exercise,&quot; said Lemerketo. He said some of his supporters did not get a chance to vote since they could not wait until afternoon. &quot;My supporters are pastoralists, they had left their livestock to come and vote for me but they went back to herd their animals,&quot; he said.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Why obsession with numbers makes us even more gullible
