The political showdown between incumbent Governor Samuel Tunai and his main rival, Joseph Tiampati, took a new turn on Wednesday when the latter picked a member of the incumbent&rsquo;s staff to be his running mate. Mr Tunai is expected to fight for his seat on a Jubilee Party ticket, while Mr Tiampati will be fighting to win the seat on an Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party ticket. Tiampati yesterday announced that William Semeiyoi, a former chief officer in charge of Labour and Disaster Management in Tunai&rsquo;s administration, will be his running mate. Tiampati, who had left many guessing who his possible running mate would be, said he had delayed naming his running mate to allow consultations. &ldquo;There have been many wanting to deputise me. That is why I took almost two years to name one,&rdquo; he said. He explained that a committee tasked with selecting his running mate had settled on Semeiyoi.

Semeiyon, who comes from the governor&rsquo;s Trans Mara backyard, has resigned from Tunai&rsquo;s administration. National Deputy Party Leader Christine Lemein and Woman Rep aspirant Rebecca Tonkei said Semeiyoi would boost Tiampati&rsquo;s lineup.
