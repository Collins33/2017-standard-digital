KAKAMEGA: National Liberal Party (NLP) presidential hopeful Kennedy Mong&rsquo;are has unveiled his running mate. Caroline Indasi from Kakamega County becomes the first woman to be named as running mate in this year&rsquo;s elections. Jubilee has already settled on Deputy President William Ruto while NASA will pick its presidential candidate and running mate from the four co-principals. Mr Mong&rsquo;are, who is Nyamira senator, said if elected president, his focus would be to liberate the country from corruption, poor leadership and reduce the cost of living. Ms Indasi said she would empower women and youths in the country if NLP will clinch the presidency.&nbsp;
