Paul Otuoma gets the nod from Registrar of Parties to run for Busia governor as an independent candidate. The Funyula MP was vying for the seat under ODM ticket against incumbent Governor Sospeter Ojaamong until April 20 when he tendered his resignation from the party citing shambolic primaries in the county. ODM party National Elections Board had ordered fresh nominations in Teso North and South constituencies. This move was however protested by MP Otuoma saying he would rather run as an independent candidate. &nbsp;
