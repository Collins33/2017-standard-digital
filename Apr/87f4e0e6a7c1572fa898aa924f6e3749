You can now sell a vehicle online hassle-free following the unveiling of a new provision by classified online service provider OLX. The new service, dubbed &ldquo;Sell it For Me&rdquo;, has shifted all the hassle from sellers to the online platform&rsquo;s new recruits to be known as &ldquo;champs.&rdquo; The champs will now be the brains behind making sure buyers and sellers transact safely and conveniently, thus weeding out con artists keen on making a quick buck from unsuspecting users. Safety Guaranteed OLX Country Manager Peter Ndiang&rsquo;ui (pictured) explained that the champs, who have been vetted to ascertain their integrity, will be responsible for handling the entire process from posting the advert online to carrying out the actual transaction. &ldquo;The seller will not have the hassle of meeting the buyer. The whole transaction is protected because we get involved directly,&rdquo; he said. To access the service, &ldquo;one logs into the platform and then selects the option of selling through a &ldquo;champ&rdquo;. A fee of Sh2,000 is charged for using the service. Once the payment is made, the champ will take over the sale process, including going to the ground, taking a photo of the vehicle and its details, before having it posted for sale. And to ensure the vehicles are 100 per cent fit, OLX has partnered with garages that will check if they have any mechanical issues. The online platform has also partnered with car bazaars and banks to facilitate those who want new vehicles.
