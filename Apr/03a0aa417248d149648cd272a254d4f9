A Mombasa resident has added to Governor Hassan Joho&#39;s woes on his academic papers. Abdalla Juma has filed a suit seeking to have the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission reject the governor&#39;s nomination papers, ultimately locking him out of the elections. After Joho obtained orders shielding him from being prosecuted or investigated regarding his school life, Mr Juma moved to the same court saying he has no academic papers to qualify him for the gubernatorial race. &quot;It is public knowledge that a candidate with KCSE D-minus cannot qualify for admission to any university in Kenya or East Africa and neither can such a candidate do a bridging course and ultimately join a university,&quot; the court papers filed by Juma&#39;s lawyer, Irungu Kang&#39;ata, say. ODM party leader Raila Odinga has been named as a respondent for issuing Joho with a nomination certificate. The applicant has asked the court to force the University of Nairobi and the Kenya National Examinations Council to produce Joho&#39;s academic papers, adding that he must have forged them.

The first respondent&#39;s tenure as a governor for the County of Mombasa between 2013 and 2017 was illegal,&quot; the papers read. &nbsp;
