KIAMBU: President Uhuru Kenyatta has ordered medics be paid for the 100 days they were on strike. The President, however, warned that the doctors will be fired if they go for another strike, saying they cannot continue to endanger the lives of Kenyans despite taking the hippocratic&nbsp;oath. Governors had declared they would not pay the medics for the period they were on the streets demanding for better pay and working environment. &quot;We are paying you but you cannot continue to endangering the lives of Kenyans,&quot; said Uhuru &quot;If they strike again, they will all go home. Not even a single doctor will go back to our hospitals because we already know what we will do,&quot; he added during his tour of Kiambu County. Uhuru said his government will pay doctors under the national government and asked governors to do the same to medics under county governments. Doctors had last month warned of another round of strike after the government refused to pay them their salaries for the over three months.
