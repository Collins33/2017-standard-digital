SYDNEY: Australian scientists are optimistic that a bank of blood donations will help them develop a vaccine for Type 1 diabetes. The team from the St Vincent&#39;s Institute of Medical Research became the first researchers in the world to observe immune cells destroy insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. They discovered that the immune cells targeted the C-peptide molecule and are now developing a blood test to measure the immune response to the molecule, which they believe causes type 1 diabetes. Stuart Mannering, an immunologist at St Vincent&#39;s, said the team was hopeful of developing a therapy that would teach the immune system not to attack the cells. &quot;That&#39;s our long term goal,&quot; Mannering told News Limited on Wednesday. &quot;The next step towards this is to measure that immune response in blood samples so we can try to detect it before people develop symptoms of Type 1 diabetes.&quot; &quot;What we would really like is a blood test that we can do after a much shorter period of time so that we can see if the immune response is going in the direction we want it.&quot; The test will be developed using samples from a biobank, a list of people willing to give blood samples for the sake of medical research. &quot;The living biobank is really essential because it allows us to do this study using human blood from people with and without diabetes and that&#39;s a really critical stepping stone... to more human-based studies so we can develop something that will be useful in the clinic,&quot; Mannering said. The team received the Diabetes Australia 2017 Millennium Award on Wednesday which comes with a grant worth 100,000 U.S. dollars.
