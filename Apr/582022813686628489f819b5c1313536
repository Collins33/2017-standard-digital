Kenya National Commission of Human Rights has moved to court seeking clarification on a clear standard to measure integrity and leadership of aspirants seeking public office ahead of the polls. The commission is seeking a determination on how the Constitution in Chapter Six should be applied by accountability institutions as a fit and proper test for all leaders seeking appointive or elective posts. It further questions whether aspirants who have been adversely mentioned in reports by constitutional commissions and independent offices should be disqualified from appointment or running for public office in accordance with the constitution. Different views &ldquo;The lower courts and Chapter Six vetting agencies have had and used different interpretations of the leadership and integrity parameter. This has blurred the importance of Chapter Six as a critical threshold for ensuring that public trust is safeguarded through ethical and prudent public leadership,&rdquo; said KNCHR Commissioner Jedidah Waruhiu. Ms Waruhiu was speaking Thursday during a press briefing at their offices after filing the application for advisory opinion. ALSO READ: Jubilee postpones nominations for Nairobi County
