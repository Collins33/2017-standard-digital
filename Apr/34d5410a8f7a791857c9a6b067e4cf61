Employers have been urged to give workers time off on Friday to enable them to vote in the Jubilee nominations. County Jubilee Party Chairman David Manyara said most employees are at work and therefore miss the chance to exercise their democratic right to nominate candidates of their choice. Mr Manyara expressed concern that some Naivasha flower farm proprietors had said they would not release workers on Friday to enable them to participate in the primaries.&nbsp;
