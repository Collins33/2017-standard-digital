WhatsApp is reportedly working on a feature that could let users unsend embarrassing messages after they have been sent. The latest beta release from the Facebook-owned messaging app reportedly includes the option to revoke a message within five minutes of it being sent. The new feature would potentially be a godsend to anyone prone to typos or drunk texting. But just because it&#39;s included in the beta release doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it will roll out to the public. Last year WhatsApp was rumoured to be working on a version of the unsend feature that only allowed users to recall messages if they hadn&#39;t already been seen by the recipient.

The latest beta release suggests WhatsApp is looking at different ways the feature could work. If feedback from the trial proves positive, there&#39;s no reason it shouldn&#39;t be rolled out more widely. According to the Twitter account @WABetaInfo, which first revealed details of the &quot;unsend&quot; feature, it is most likely to launch with WhatsApp&#39;s next official iOS update. The beta release includes a number of other changes the the app, including new font shortcuts and the ability to share your location with other users. There&#39;s also a new &quot;change number&quot; feature, which could make it easier to notify your contacts if you change your phone number. According to a screenshot shared by @WABetaInfo, the new feature will allow users to notify all their contacts automatically with a single tap. ALSO READ: Young luxury buyers using Instagram, WhatsApp
