Mary Keitany and Daniel Wanjiru&#39;s spectacular performance at the London Marathon Sunday speaks volumes of Kenya&#39;s athletics prowess. Keitany&#39;s 2:17.01 record lowered Paula Radcliffe&#39;s 2:17.18 women only record with a display that shows she can go for the absolute record of 2:15.25. Their conquest of London comes hot on the heels of another superlative performance by Geoffrey Kirui and Edna Kiplagat in Boston, USA. Eliud Kipchoge, too, capped Kenya&#39;s dominance of man&#39;s most daunting race, the 42km race, for being the overall winner of the World Marathon Majors that takes place in major capitals around the world. The World Marathon Majors organisers are yet to declare the women&#39;s winner because the series leader Jemima Sumgong is facing doping charges. And that is where Kenya&#39;s Achilles heel lies. With such outstanding performance of our heroes and heroines comes closer scrutiny as to whether the rousing results are legally earned. Kenya has been under the watch of athletics eye, and it has not helped matters that Olympic Marathon champion Sumgong tested positive for a banned substance.

Kenya must continue scaling new heights.
