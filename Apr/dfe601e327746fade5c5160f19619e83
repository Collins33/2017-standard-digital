Kanu leaders in West Pokot County have ridiculed Jubilee Party for conducting shambolic primaries in the country and urged disgruntled aspirants to join Kanu. Led by West Pokot senator John Lonyangapuo, the leaders said Kanu conducted peaceful and fair nominations in the county thus the JP need to come for benchmarking in Kanu. Speaking after handing over certificates to aspirants who were nominated after Kanu peaceful primaries that were held on Friday, Professor Lonyangapuo said JP has no experience in handling political matters and those who caused the problems have ashamed president Uhuru Kenyatta. &quot;Some of JP leaders were bragging that the party is the best in the country. JP is not mature in politics and they should come and benchmark with Kanu because it has so many years of experience in campaigns and nominations,&quot; he said. He asked security officers to investigate incidences where some of the county government officers were allegedly employed as clerks and presiding officers to head the nominations hence causing a lot of anomalies. &quot;It is so shameful for the county government to use public resources and county vehicles for campaigns, if they are not prepared enough, then they should not vie for any political seat, why should they disrupt our peace,&quot; he said.
