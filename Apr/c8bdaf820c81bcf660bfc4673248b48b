Former Central Imenti MP Gitobu Imanyara has advised Senator Kiraitu Murungi to retire from active politics. Addressing journalists at Muthangene Primary School in the constituency, where he held a rally, Mr Imanyara said the senator had failed to lobby for development projects the entire time he has been in politics. &quot;The opinion polls released recently by Infotrak reflect what is at the grassroots, though it is not necessarily the picture that will be there during the August election,&quot; said Imanyara. He added: &quot;The reason Governor Peter Munya is ahead of Kiraitu and might win is that Meru people no longer trust the senator after he folded the APK party. Kiraitu had told the people that in order to be in power, they must have the identity of a political party and formed the APK. Now, even before the five years are over, he wants us to return where we were in the past, so where is he taking Meru? That implies he is a selfish leader.&quot; Imanyara is vying for MP on a Maendeleo Chap Chap ticket. &quot;What will make Munya win is because he remains with the agenda that he and Kiraitu sold to the people when they were together,&quot; Imanyara added.

The people no longer trust him after he broke an agreement that the Meru leaders and the Njuri Ncheke elders had agreed on. Kiraitu used to call for Moi to retire from politics and advised him to go and grow coffee. He should do the same. This is poetic justice for what he advised Moi to do,&quot; he said. Kiraitu&#39;s communications director, Patrick Muriungi, dismissed Imanyara, saying he is full of malice. &quot;The election laws do not prohibit one to vie because of age,&quot; he said.
