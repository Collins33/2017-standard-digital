NAIROBI, KENYA: Business tycoon Chris Kirubi has told off Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko over an offer to join his team of advisors. Speaking to the Standard Digital on phone, Kirubi said he has never spoken nor met Sonko to discuss possibilities of working with him. &quot;How do you offer someone a job you have never met or spoken to? I don&#39;t know this man neither do I have his number nor I don&#39;t think he has my number,&quot; Kirubi quipped. On Saturday morning, Sonko went to his Facebook page and said his critics say he&#39;s not a PhD. holder but that will not stop from serving the people of Nairobi as Governor. Once elected, the Senator said he will bring on board technocrats with whom he is going to work with in policy making, implementation and pushing for Nairobi County&rsquo;s development and economic agenda. &quot;I am and has always been a team player who will delegate, assign, and appoint professionals to run the affairs of the county. To that effect, plans are underway to make investor CHRIS KIRUBI as our county&#39;s Chief Economic Advisor,&quot; Sonko&#39;s post read in part. However Sunday afternoon, Kirubi said he is not interested in the job and asked Sonko to keep it. &quot;I am not interested in politics. I work for international organisations and I have no time for Sonko. Let him keep his job,&quot; the businessman who is associated with the new Two Rivers Mall, Capital FM, International Life House, Nairobi Bottlers Ltd, Haco industries among others said. Sonko is fighting out for the Jubilee Party ticket against former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth and Bishop Margaret Wanjiru. The nominations for the JP ticket which was slated for today have been pushed to Wednesday. In the same Facebook page, Sonko had asked supporters to recommend to him whom between businessman Jimnah Mbaru and former Nairobi town clerk John Gakuo should be his running mate in the event President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s party picks him to face incumbent Evans Kidero of ODM.
