Mr Mbugua joined the growing list of incumbents who have been rejected by voters as former National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (NACADA) chairman John Mututho came third with 30,487 votes. Accepted defeat Soon after being announced the winner by County Returning Officer Jepter Rono, Kinyanjui urged Mbugua to support him this time round, saying in 2013 he accepted defeat and went on to back Mbugua at the polls. But moments later, Governor Mbugua said the primaries were rigged. ALSO READ: Jamleck claims rigging but will not appeal &ldquo;The elections were not free and fair. Most of the polling stations had high numbers of those who voted than the registered voters,&rdquo; he said, adding that there were conflicting figures of those who voted for governor aspirants and those who cast their ballot for senatorial aspirants. A total of four women won the Jubilee nominations for various seats, including Susan Kihika (Senate), Liza Chelule (woman rep), former MP Jane Kihara (Naivasha parliamentary seat) and Charity Gathambi (Njoro Constituency). &ldquo;It is encouraging to see Jubilee Party giving opportunity to women who want to change the politics of this country,&rdquo; said Kinyanjui. Kinyanjui, Kihika and Chelule said they would work with the losers to ensure President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto are re-elected on August 8. &ldquo;We intend to ensure 100 per cent voter turnout in the August elections so that we can increase the number of votes from 400,000 to 900,000,&rdquo; said Kinyanjui.
