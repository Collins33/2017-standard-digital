The National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) has accused the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM)&nbsp;of frustrating democracy in the just concluded party primaries. Led by Chairman Bishop Simon Achar, the clergymen claimed that the party had denied the electorate the chance to know the rightful winners of the nominations. In the last few days, several declarations of winners by different officials have rocked the region with a number of candidates claiming they are the rightful victors. ODM has since said the party will only recognise the results declared by the returning officers only. And Friday, clergymen accused ODM of perpetrating several ills that does not promote democracy in the just concluded exercise.&nbsp;
