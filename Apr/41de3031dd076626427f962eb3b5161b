MOMBASA, KENYA: Coast tourist hotels are projecting a 70 per cent bookings across the region over the Easter festive season. According to the Kenya Association of Hotel-keepers and Caterers (Kahc) Coast branch Executive Officer, Mr Sam Ikwaye , domestic tourists have continued to provide the number of tourist arrivals in hotels and lodges along the Coastal tourism circuit. &#39;&#39; However, we are seeing the length of stay in hotels just slightly above the one week Easter period. From there on , there will be a drop in occupancies in hotels in the region with some in the predominantly North Coast areas around Malindi and Watamu and the South Coast closing down for the traditional low season to carry out repairs,&#39;&#39; Ikwaye said. At the same time, Ikwaye has said that the introduction of a direct flight from Moi International Airport (MIA), Mombasa to Lamu&#39;s Manda Airport by the fast growing low cost carrier- Skyward Express Limited is a timely boost to revival of tourism in the archipelago destination. &#39;&#39; Overtime, accessibility to most of the Kenyan Coast destination has been a major challenge but with the introduction of the direct flight by Skyward Express Limited from Mombasa , this will be a major boost to both business and leisure travellers,&#39;&#39; Ikwaye said. A spot check by The Standard in most hotels revealed over 60 per cent bookings with others recording a 100 per cent occupancy over the Easter period.
