The Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) is set to train afresh a pool of officials in supervising and marking examinations. Knec acting Chief Executive Officer Mercy Karogo said the training for the teachers was aimed at preparing them to become examiners for the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examinations. The trained team will also be used to examine Primary Teacher Education (PTE), Early Childhood Development Education-Proficiency (ECDE) and Diploma in Teacher Education (DTE) examinations. &quot;The training will take place between April 23 and 29. The venue for training will be communicated to qualified applicants at a later date,&quot; said Ms Karogo. She said the people to be recruited for the training were practising teachers in the relevant examination areas. She said they must be registered by the Teachers Service Commission and have a minimum teaching experience of three years. &nbsp;
