Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama has been declared the winner of the Nyamira ODM governor primaries in results announced Wednesday morning. Nyagarama garnered 17,012 votes against West Mugirango MP James Gesami&#39;s 12,126 votes. Dr John Kumenda reaped 939. The County Returning officer Thadius Nyanchwaya announced the results at Kebirigo High School. Hours before the results were announced, Gesami and Kumenda raised a number of issues alleging to a well-organized scheme to rig them out of the party. Dr Gesami seemed&nbsp;to cast doubt on some of the party&#39;s National Elections Board whom he accused of ignoring his complains. He said he had made several calls to the Elections Board chairperson Judith Pareno and even wrote several complaint letters before the nomination exercise but were not replied to.

In a number polling centers including Sironga primary voting begun as late as late on Tuesday afternoon, while in&nbsp;other&nbsp;stations, returning officers were forced to close down polling centres before votes were cast due to numerous anomalies. Despite losing&nbsp;in the party primaries, Gesami maintains that he will not quit the party. &quot;I better retire from politics and remain in the party,&quot; he said. He added: &quot;I don&#39;t mind going for a repeat. All we need is a fair decision by the Party&#39;s National Elections Board. This &nbsp;exercise&nbsp;was totally disorganized with my name missing in the ballot papers which were presented in some polling centers.&quot; If the party&#39;s NEB upholds the results then Governor Nyagarama could be headed for his second term in power due to the overwhelming support of the ODM party in the region. But this will also depend on Gesami&#39;s next political move. His close allies argue that Gesami could be going to the next general elections as an independent candidate or support Nyagarama&#39;s rival. In a clan based political landscape, Gesami and Kumenda represents the largest clans in Nyamira; Abigrango and Abgetutu respectively. Gesami has also had a cordial relationship with the four MPs from the region including the County MP both of whom had received their nomination certificates a month ago.
