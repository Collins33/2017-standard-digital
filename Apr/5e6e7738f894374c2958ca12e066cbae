Tanzania has expelled the top official of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in the country, the foreign ministry has said. It ordered Awa Dabo, a Gambian, to leave because her relationship with some of her staff had become strained, resulting in the UNDP&#39;s performance in Tanzania deteriorating, it added. The ministry said it wanted to remind the UNDP to work with the government.
