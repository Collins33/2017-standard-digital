Gubernatorial aspirant Margaret Wanjiru has denied giving out money to supporters in one of her rallies. A video clip trending online shows Ms Wanjiru who fighting for the Jubilee Party ticket together with Senator Mike Mbuvi Sonko and former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth, dishing out money. But the former Starehe MP has denied being the one captured in the video. &quot;That is the work of my detractors. I have been in politics long enough to know that giving money to supporters is a crime,&quot; Wanjiru said. In the video, wads of cash are being dished out to people crowding around her car. Some are heard saying they can&#39;t risk their lives over the Sh50 being given out as it is too little.
