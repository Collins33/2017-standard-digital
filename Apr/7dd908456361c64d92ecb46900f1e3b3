The&nbsp;word&nbsp;&lsquo;Kenyan&nbsp;politician&rsquo;,&nbsp;conjures&nbsp;up&nbsp;images&nbsp;of a&nbsp;crude&nbsp;and&nbsp;sweaty&nbsp;hooligan,&nbsp;more&nbsp;at&nbsp;home&nbsp;in a&nbsp;boisterous&nbsp;wrestling&nbsp;hall,&nbsp;than&nbsp;the&nbsp;solemn&nbsp;chambers&nbsp;of&nbsp;Parliament. This is probably because the loudmouthed yobs with little between their ears are the&nbsp;&lsquo;waheshimiwa&rsquo;&nbsp;seen in the media&nbsp;more&nbsp;often&nbsp;than&nbsp;the calm and composed representatives working diligently outside the limelight. One of these latter folk is Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi Wetang&rsquo;ula. Calm, amiable, soft-spoken and gentlemanly to a fault, Tim is an anomaly in&nbsp;Kenyan&nbsp;politics. &ldquo;I am a humble person, very patient and very caring. I take myself to the level of the people I am representing when they come to me. I want people to do better because of interacting with me,&rdquo; he says. Nairobi MP &lsquo;Patient&rsquo; and &lsquo;caring&rsquo; are&nbsp;words&nbsp;that one could swear are antithetical to the&nbsp;Kenyan&nbsp;political realm, a space populated&nbsp;more&nbsp;with violence and strife&nbsp;than&nbsp;the humanism this 45-year-old legislator espouses.

An Infotrak survey released at the end of March 2017 placed him as the top-most Nairobi MP likely to be re-elected, at 64.4 per cent. Having survived almost 10 years in politics - five years as a councilor in Nairobi&rsquo;s City&nbsp;Hall, and then going on to win a parliamentary seat in an urban constituency - shows he cannot be taken lightly. Add to this, achieving all this from the confines of a wheelchair. Nominated councillor Cutting the&nbsp;image&nbsp;of a white dove in a field of jackals, Tim avers that politics was never really a &lsquo;calling&rsquo;. &ldquo;I joined politics by default, finding myself there in 2007 when I was drafted into Raila Odinga&rsquo;s campaign team. I wanted people with disability to be heard, because they are&nbsp;usually never involved. After the campaigns, I found myself being nominated as a councilor to City&nbsp;Hall.&rdquo; Terming it a good experience due to the manner in which it introduced him to the crudest politics on the scene, he was determined that diplomacy and intellectualism would be respected and not brawn. &ldquo;Sometimes chairs would fly but most of the time it was debate.&rdquo; At City&nbsp;Hall, Tim took&nbsp;up&nbsp;the disability agenda with zeal, instituting changes to ensure facilities for people with disabilities were introduced to the building, Nairobi streets, and other public areas, and also ensuring laws were put in place to ensure licensing requirements included accommodation of people with disabilities and the old being taken into consideration. His older brother, NASA co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula being a&nbsp;more&nbsp;imposing and better known figure, Tim has over the years had to overtly try to carve out his own identity and niche, first as a lawyer (Moses is also a lawyer), then as a&nbsp;politician.

We are similar in our ability to be meticulous in what we do, but different in that Moses is&nbsp;more&nbsp;aggressive&nbsp;than&nbsp;I; he is&nbsp;more&nbsp;of a&nbsp;politician.&rdquo; Tim outlines the work he has been doing in his constituency. &ldquo;We have achieved nearly 90 per cent of our goals. All public primary schools in the constituency now have computer labs. We used CDF to refurbish schools. Enrollment has shot&nbsp;up&nbsp;from 800 to 2,000 students.&rdquo; The education sector has been his biggest priority in the constituency, with him even setting&nbsp;up&nbsp;a private foundation where he donates 20 per cent of his salary to. The foundation which has sponsored over 200 children in the last five years, assists children who cannot access education due to lack of school fees, to go to school. Women and youth empowerment have been his other pet projects, setting&nbsp;up&nbsp;table banking programmes for over 100 women groups and training and entrepreneurship programmes for youths in youth groups. &ldquo;We have also done a lot towards security. We built police houses at Spring Valley Police Station so that whenever back&nbsp;up&nbsp;is needed at a crime scene in the middle of the night, police officers do not have to come from Eastlands or wherever else they live.&rdquo; A grim realist, he also admits he and his full time staff of 15 have encountered challenges including too high expectations, overwhelming needs of constituents and struggling to appear fair so as not to be accused of favouring any ethnic community. Robbery incident ALSO READ: Former Jubilee officials say they were fired in scramble for Sh300m tender What does he think he has not done yet and would still like to do? &ldquo;I still feel like my education sector is not fully there yet. We barely have any public secondary schools in the constituency. There are only two boy schools - Hospital Hill and Kangemi High School. This leads to many of the children here falling out of school and not having anywhere to go. So we have started four schools this year and we want them to be&nbsp;up&nbsp;and running within the next two years.&rdquo; Born in Mukhweya in Bungoma town, Timothy Wanyonyi is the seventh born child to Anne and Dominic Wetang&rsquo;ula, a farmer and teacher respectively. Tim is a family man with two girls and a son. Role models A car robbery incident in 1998 led to an irreparable spinal injury, which has since confined him to a wheelchair. Prior to joining politics in 2007, Tim had been practising law for 11 years and championing for rights for persons with disability. Following his own accident, he founded the Kenya Paraplegic Organisation in 2004, an organisation that helps people with spinal cord problems. Tim&rsquo;s role models in politics range from Raila, to Margaret Thatcher; and from James Orengo to Mwai Kibaki and Julius Nyerere. He will defend his seat in the August elections.

These priorities should be dictated by the needs of your area.&rdquo;
