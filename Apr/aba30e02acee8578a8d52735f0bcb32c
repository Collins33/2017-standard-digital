Jubilee Party will not hold its primaries in Nairobi County on Friday April 21 as earlier planned. The party Secretariat Wednesday evening announced that the polls will instead be conducted on Monday next week. &quot;In response to major representations to the party by the large Muslim Community in Nairobi the National Executive Committee in consultation with the National Elections Board has postponed the Jubilee party primaries from Friday 21 to Monday 24 of April,&quot; said party Secretary General Raphael Tuju. Aspirants and Jubilee Party members were requested to take note of the schedule of primaries to confirm the day of nominations with respect to their county. Jubilee Party had earlier in the day announced that it had staggered its primaries which were initially scheduled for April 21 to also include April 25. The postponement of the Jubilee primaries in Nairobi means that the Friday exercise will be held in only 21 counties: &nbsp;Kirinyaga, Elgeyo Marakwet, Meru, Usian Gishu, Baringo, Bomet, Laikipia, Murang&#39;a, Tharaka Nithi, Kiambu, Nyandarua, Embu, Kericho, West Pokot, Nandi, Nakuru, Nyeri, Kajiado, Narok, Trans Nzoia and Taita Taveta.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Chama Cha Mashinani calls off nominations for lack of ballot papers
