MCAs unanimously passed the Sh13.2 billion 2017-2018 budget estimates during a special plenary sitting on Thursday. The house also gave the nod to changes to the county supplementary budget estimates for 2016-2017 to allow the completion of projects, including upgrading of health facilities and opening up roads across the county&#39;s 60 wards. The approval is a relief to Governor&nbsp;Wycliffe Oparanya, who would like to ensure that all projects are completed during this electioneering period.
