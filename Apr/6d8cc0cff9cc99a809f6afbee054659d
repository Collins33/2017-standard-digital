Bomet Governor and Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) party leader Isaac Ruto is confident he will beat the Jubilee Party candidate in the governorship race during the August 8 elections. Speaking yesterday soon after Jubilee Party kicked off its nominations in the county, Mr Ruto defended his move to join National Super Alliance (NASA) as the fifth co-principal, saying it has boosted his chance of re-election. &ldquo;Joining NASA was a political decision I took without any regrets. CCM supporters and the Kipsigis community at large are fully behind me,&rdquo; said the governor. Three aspirants were yesterday fighting it out for the Jubilee Party ticket to face Governor Ruto in the August 8 polls. They are National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso, Dr Julius Kones and Bomet Deputy Governor Stephen Mutai. The campaign for the Bomet gubernatorial seat is expected to be one of the hottest in Rift Valley region, with Deputy President William Ruto having vowed to camp in the area and ensure the incumbent is voted out.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Former Minister Kipkalya Kones's son clinches CCM ticket
