By 4.30pm Sunday, it was not clear if a new board had been constituted. The Political Parties Disputes Tribunal disbanded the board following a suit filed by two voters, who claimed it was wrongly constituted. A section of aspirants raised fears that the confusion would create unnecessary anxiety during the exercise, which is expected to be hotly contested in almost all the seats. Mixed feelings Senatorial aspirant Fred Outa, National Assembly aspirants Sam Okello, and Richard Ogendo, both seeking Kisumu Central constituency seat, as well as Kennedy Onyango who is seeking Kisumu West constituency seat told The Standard that they were optimistic the exercise would be free and fair.
