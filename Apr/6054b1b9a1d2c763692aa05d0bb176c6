A policeman accidentally shot and injured himself and a suspect he had arrested in Kayole. The officer and his colleagues had arrested a group of suspects and put them in their Land Cruiser when his gun&#39;s trigger went off, discharging two bullets that hit his left leg. The second bullet hit and injured one of the suspects in the leg.&nbsp; The suspects had been arrested in Dandora and were being taken to the police station. Kayole OCPD Joseph Gichangi termed the incident an accident and added they were both taken to the hospital where they were admitted. But the suspect was discharged after treatment. Cases of armed robberies have been on the rise in the area with many of them being blamed on the proscribed Gaza gang.
