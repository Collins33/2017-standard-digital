A military court in Somalia has executed four men it said were Al Shabaab militants who were behind a 2016 attack that killed 80 people, a military officer said on Tuesday. The four men were executed in Baidoa, which lies about 245km northwest of Mogadishu. The same court executed a policeman who was accused of killing a civilian and wounding the victim&#39;s two sons, officials said. The four were found guilty of being responsible for blasts.
