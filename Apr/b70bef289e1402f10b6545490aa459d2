Jubilee aspirants in Tharaka-Nithi County have warned of mass&nbsp;defections&nbsp;from the party if the nominations will not be free and fair. Addressing the Press in Chuka town, Saturday, Maara MP Kareke Mbiuki said some aspirants would consider contesting as independent candidates. He warned Jubilee Party leader, President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto to prepare for&nbsp;defections&nbsp;if the repeat exercise after the one cancelled on Friday, will not be credible. Mr Mbiuki called for disciplinary action against those who orchestrated violence. Tharaka Nithi Women Representative Beatrice Nkatha demanded that the party prints different ballot papers to avert rigging. Chuka/Igambang&#39;ombe MP Muthomi Njuki who is vying for governorship noted that the logistical challenges marred the nominations.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Sorry, Uhuru to his supporters
