Jubilee Party primaries in Mt Elgon constituency have been postponed due to lack of ballot papers. The exercise will now be conducted on Wednesday. The decision was agreed upon by aspirants and the returning officer after holding a consultative meeting in Kapsokwony. Ballot papers failed to reach various areas of the expansive constituency. Returning Officer, Ronald Ruto, stated that there were logistical challenges that hampered the start of the exercise. &quot;Certain areas could not go on with the exercise as they had not received any ballot paper. An area like Cheptais has not received a ballot paper in the whole ward,&quot; said Ruto.
