NAIROBI: After&nbsp;captivating&nbsp;the&nbsp;country&nbsp;with&nbsp;eye-popping&nbsp;details&nbsp;about&nbsp;how&nbsp;a&nbsp;colossal&nbsp;Sh1.4&nbsp;billion&nbsp;was&nbsp;stolen&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;National&nbsp;YouthService&nbsp;(NYS) and&nbsp;part&nbsp;of the&nbsp;loot&nbsp;carted&nbsp;away&nbsp;in&nbsp;gunny&nbsp;bags,&nbsp;MPs&nbsp;do&nbsp;not&nbsp;have&nbsp;the&nbsp;time&nbsp;to&nbsp;debate&nbsp;the&nbsp;explosive&nbsp;report&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Public&nbsp;Accounts&nbsp;Committee! It is the final hurdle that has plagued the PAC investigation that has survived the ignominy of claims of extortion and bribery to alter the findings; undue pressure to water down the recommendations and even abrupt quorum hitches to delay adoption of the&nbsp;report&nbsp;at&nbsp;committee&nbsp;level. Packed agenda Now,&nbsp;time&nbsp;and packed agenda&nbsp;have&nbsp;conspired to snuff whatever life was left in the&nbsp;report. The House leadership released its new priorities for the remainder of their term, that is, until June 16, when they will take their final recess to go into the rough and tumble of campaigns ahead of the August 8 polls. The&nbsp;NYS&nbsp;report&nbsp;is conspicuously absent. Instead, the House Business&nbsp;Committee&nbsp;has lined up the 2017/18&nbsp;national&nbsp;budget, 13 Bills on the budget and some that&nbsp;have&nbsp;been pending since last year, plus half-a-dozen regulations that deal with the upcoming elections as the key items that&nbsp;have&nbsp;to be passed in the short remaining life of the current Parliament. The term of this Parliament expires on the date of the next General Election.

PAC Chairman Nicholas Gumbo is now planning to meet Speaker Justin Muturi to ask him to push the House leadership to include the&nbsp;NYS&nbsp;report&nbsp;among the prioritised items. &ldquo;I will talk to the Speaker so that we create&nbsp;time&nbsp;to&nbsp;have&nbsp;the matter&nbsp;debated. It has to be&nbsp;debated&nbsp;before the House makes a decision on it,&rdquo; Gumbo told Sunday Standard. But Gumbo is not worried that&nbsp;after&nbsp;all the hard work the&nbsp;report&nbsp;had been dropped&nbsp;from&nbsp;the priority items, because, when weighed against the budget, and the Bills to ensure the budget is implemented, the&nbsp;NYS&nbsp;report&nbsp;comes at the bottom of the list. The fact that this&nbsp;report&nbsp;is now being placed in the parliamentary shelves to gather dust mirrors the &lsquo;Hustler&rsquo;s Jet&rsquo;&nbsp;report&nbsp;which investigated the hiring of a private luxury plane for Deputy President William Ruto. The Hustler&rsquo;s Jet&nbsp;report&nbsp;sat in the parliamentary shelves for 15 months. When it was brought to the House in August 2015, it was thrown out. In terms of parliamentary days, the House has only planned for 21 days between now and election day. In that&nbsp;time, the&nbsp;MPs&nbsp;say they&nbsp;have&nbsp;to pass at least 13 Bills. The House is also grappling with the judicial deadline for a Bill to ensure that no more than two thirds of those appointed or elected to&nbsp;public&nbsp;service&nbsp;are&nbsp;from&nbsp;one gender or risk dissolution by end of May for not complying with a court deadline. In between, there&rsquo;s the issue of nomination of candidates by political parties.

The issue of the&nbsp;NYS&nbsp;report&nbsp;may be next, but that is a decision of the House Business&nbsp;Committee,&rdquo; said Deputy Minority Whip Chris Wamalwa. Unless the House votes to extend sittings and to&nbsp;have&nbsp;extra sittings, it has limited&nbsp;time. Gumbo says the&nbsp;NYS&nbsp;report&nbsp;needs at least two days of&nbsp;debate, and that will be sufficient for the House to make a decision bearing in mind the limited&nbsp;time. The&nbsp;report&nbsp;reads like a thorough piece of work, with huge ramifications on&nbsp;public&nbsp;spending, the government&rsquo;s management of&nbsp;public&nbsp;funds and the integrity of State officers, and it ought not to be rushed. The counter-argument is that nearly everything that passes through the House is important, and undue emphasis should not be placed on the PAC&nbsp;report. But there is a problem: Quorum. &ldquo;Even the last Parliaments&nbsp;have&nbsp;experienced these kinds of problems notwithstanding the fact that in the past, the election date was never known. Kenyans thought it was better to state it in the Constitution, but it is impacting on us negatively,&rdquo; Muturi moaned on Thursday in the House,&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;MPs&nbsp;failed to raise quorum at 2.30pm when the House business usually begins. The&nbsp;MPs&nbsp;had to wait for a few minutes to get the quorum&mdash;something that is unprecedented on Budget Day. The failure to&nbsp;debate&nbsp;the PAC&nbsp;report, which recommends large-scale investigations into the role of commercial banks, private companies and government officials in the multi-million shilling heist, means that the hope for Kenyans to understand the enormity of the theft now lies in the Judiciary. Two high-profile&nbsp;committee&nbsp;witnesses, whose role in the scandal, the&nbsp;MPs&nbsp;said, had to be investigated, are angling for elective positions in the General Election. Leadership failures The&nbsp;report&nbsp;also had a recommendation forensic audits of&nbsp; government books, revamping the Banking Act, and regulations to tighten the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act. Now that the&nbsp;report&nbsp;won&rsquo;t be&nbsp;debated, at least going by the timetable, the move somewhat guarantees that no one will interfere with the budding careers of former Devolution Minister Anne Waiguru who is vying to be the new governor of Kirinyaga, and Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, who wants to retain his seat.
