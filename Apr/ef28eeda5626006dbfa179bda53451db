Reprieve for Bishop Margaret Wanjiru after High Court releases her on Sh100, 000 cash bail, overturning five-day detention handed by lower court. Bishop Wanjiru had earlier moved to court where she filed a case for bail review arguing that detaining her for five days violated her rights. The Bishop&nbsp;had been arraigned in court for&nbsp;disrupting Jubilee primaries and malicious damage to property. &nbsp;
