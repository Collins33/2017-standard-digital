President Uhuru has apologised to Kenyans for under-preparedness in Jubilee primaries on Friday that led to cancellation of the entire exercise in all 21 counties. Speaking at State House, Uhuru said they did not expect such huge voter turnout hence the inadequacy of ballot materials became a challenge at the polling stations. He reckoned Jubilee&rsquo;s democratic will to deliver free, fair and credible elections saying he is ready to go by the will of his supporters at the primaries. Uhuru dismissed allegations that Jubilee Party top leaders have preferred list of candidates. This is after party&rsquo;s supporters in Uasin Gishu County claimed that Deputy President William Ruto has a desired list of aspirants that were to fly the Jubilee flag in the next election. &ldquo;The party and the National Election Board are now remapping entire process taking into account the massive turn out experienced on Friday,&rdquo; he added. Uhuru said a detailed and revised primaries timetable will be issued at Jubilee Party&rsquo;s headquarter today in accordance with IEBC time lines.
