Karachuonyo MP James Rege has announced that he will not defend his seat in the August elections. Instead Mr Rege (right) says he will join President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s campaign team. &ldquo;I have sacrificed my political ambitions to ensure that President Kenyatta retains his seat,&rdquo; said Rege, who defected from the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) last year. His announcement brings to an end speculation on the MP&#39;s political future after no political party forwarded his name to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) for gazettment. Last week Rege indicated that he was considering running as an independent candidate. Rege, who was serving his second term in Parliament on an ODM ticket, told The Standard yesterday that he has sacrificed his re-election to lead Kenyatta&rsquo;s campaign team in the western and Nyanza regions.

He expressed optimism that Jubilee would win in the August 8 polls. A record 18 aspirants have lined up to succeed Mr Rege and will battle it out in today&#39;s ODM nominations.
