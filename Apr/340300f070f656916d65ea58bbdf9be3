Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi and Senator Kiraitu Murungi will get Jubilee Party tickets unopposed. The two are among the many politicians who will receive the Jubilee ticket without sweating it out at the party nominations slated for April 21, as they are unopposed. County Jubilee Party branch Secretary Al Hajj Mwendia said others who would receive the tickets unopposed include Buuri parliamentary aspirant Mugambi Lindikiri, Igembe South MP aspirant Rufus Miriti and Tigania East MP Mpuru Aburi. Mr Mwendia said since no challengers had shown interest, the party had no choice but to start supporting them to ensure the seats are won by Jubilee. &ldquo;We are going to campaign for them and ask the national office to support them,&rdquo; said Mwendia.

However, fierce campaigns are expected for other legislative seats. Mwendia said the parliamentary seat primaries will be fierce, as all contestants are strong. &ldquo;In South Imenti, we have Gideon Kimathi, Shadrack Mwiti, Mwiti Kathara and Mwiti Kairu. In Imenti North there is incumbent Rahim Dawood and former Interior Principal Secretary Mutea Iringo. In Igembe North there are Joseph M&rsquo;eruaki and Knut&rsquo;s Julius Taitumu,&rdquo; Mwendia said as he appealed to losers to support the winners because they will also get opportunities in the party. &ldquo;We are sure of forming the county and national governments after the elections. We have certificates of all contestants and would like to assure them they will be part of Government,&rdquo; he said and encouraged all to market themselves well.&nbsp;
