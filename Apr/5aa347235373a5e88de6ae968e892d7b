A lawyer has said it is not illegal for the Opposition to have a parallel tallying centre during the August 8 polls. The lawyer claimed there is no law barring the National Super Alliance (NASA) from holding a parallel tallying centre. Former Law Society of Kenya president Aggrey Mwamu dismissed claims by IEBC that the Opposition&rsquo;s intention was ill-informed and against the law. &ldquo;There is no clause in the Constitution that states that the Opposition or any Kenyan cannot have a parallel tallying centre to that of IEBC,&rsquo;&rsquo; argued Mr Mwamu. He said just as IEBC has a tallying centre, so is any Kenyan entitled to create one to monitor the elections and tallying of votes.
