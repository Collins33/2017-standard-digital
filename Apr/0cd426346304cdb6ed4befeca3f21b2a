Amid the cacophony of politicking something new is being breathed into our lives. The much-maligned education system that has over the years been blamed for churning out half-baked graduates is set to be replaced. Amidst great fanfare and ceremony, the 8-4-4 system of education was launched in 1985. It was hailed for its model that promoted practical learning in lessons like Home Science and Wood Work, Metal Work, Agriculture, Art and Craft. It seemed to have run its course after it was remodeled severally to suit the changing needs of the job market. So what is being scrapped is not the original model of education. Despite scoring high marks, 8-4-4 learners, it was observed, remained deficient in critical thinking, problem-solving skills and emotional intelligence. These are critical resources in the workplace and generally, in life. Today, the ministry of education launches training for select teachers drawn from 10 schools in each of the 47counties who will run the new curriculum on a pilot basis when schools open for the second term in May. The pilot basis will determine whether full implementation will effected in January 2018 even though the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) is of the opinion that would be rushing matters. &nbsp;Issues raised by KNUT, especially on lack of inclusion of all players, should not be dismissed out of hand, for it is necessary to develop and operationalise an education system that will stand the test of time. The recriminations witnessed over the 8-4-4 system should not be allowed to repeat themselves in future.

The new system, however, will be as good as the content that will be inculcated into the learners. Otherwise it will simply be a case of pouring new wine into old wine-skins.
