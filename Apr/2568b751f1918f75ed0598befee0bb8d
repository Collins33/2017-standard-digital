NAIROBI, KENYA: Kenyans on Wednesday shared different opinions following a survey indicating that the economy under Jubilee government added over 800, 000 jobs in 2016. While many questioned about the number, some wondered on the quality of the jobs created during the period under review. According to Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. In 2016, the economy generated over 800,000 new jobs of which 85.6 thousand were in the modern sector while 747.3 thousand were in the informal sector.

Kenyans are not blind.&rdquo; Mark Iyadi from Universit&eacute; de kinshasa (UNIKIN) was more graphic in his argument asking tough questions. &ldquo;In 2016 Karuturi Flowers retrenched 2,600, Posta Kenya retrenched 2,000, Telkom Kenya retrenched 1,600, East African Portland retrenched 1,000 employees, Kenya Flouspur 700, Sameer retrenched 600, Kenya Airways retrenched 600, Equity Bank retrenched 400, Stanchart Bank 300, Nation retrenched, Citizen retrenched plus many others. These are entities across the various sectors of the Economy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Na hizi 800,000 jobs ziko wapi I apply for just one of them? Kuuliza tu,&rdquo; he continued. A group calling itself Kenyan Individuals against tribal utterances simply said &ldquo;When what you hear and what you see don&#39;t match, trust your eyes.&rdquo; But Martin Mugambi Kaburu Njue writing from Copenhagen, Denmark simply thinks Kenyans do not appreciate their country&rsquo;s achievements&middot; &ldquo;Look at the pessimists who do not want to hear anything positive being said about their country. Look at them. Wasaliti wote,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;We should encourage them to move to utopia where all is rosy and pure. Bure kabisa. I am proud of what Kenyans are accomplishing.&rdquo;
