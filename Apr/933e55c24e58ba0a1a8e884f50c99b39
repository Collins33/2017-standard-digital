The hopes of many Nairobi residents were dashed yesterday after it was announced that water rationing would continue despite the heavy rains pounding the city and its environs. The Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company said the rains would not help to raise the water levels at Ndakaini Dam, the main source of water for the city, supplying 84 per cent of its needs. &quot;The precipitation is nothing significant really because the rains are here in Nairobi and not the catchment areas, making it hard to raise the water level at Ndakaini Dam,&quot; said Mbaruku Vyakweli, the company&#39;s corporate communications officer. Vyakweli said the water level at Ndakaini had dropped to an all-time low of 24 per cent, falling by seven per cent in January alone. He attributed the sharp decline to drought in the Aberdare, Kikuyu, and Mt Kenya regions, the main water catchments for rivers feeding the dam. Hopeless situation &quot;The situation at Ndakaini is really bad and we hope that the rains will continue. We will conduct our review of the rationing in two weeks,&quot; he said.

He added that the county was looking into other options such as tapping underground water and recycling drain water.
