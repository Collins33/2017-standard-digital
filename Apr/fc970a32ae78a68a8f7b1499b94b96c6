Daniel Sifa Wanje, 22, who comes from a humble background, was over the moon when Mount Kenya University (MKU) founder and chairman, Prof (Dr) Simon Gicharu handed him a letter confirming an initial one-year support for his admission for a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery at the institution. Daniel sat his KCSE examination in 2015 at Ribe Boys High School and scored B+ and was determined to sell his vital organ to secure admission at the private university. &nbsp;In a letter to Mr Wanje dated April 15 and signed by Gicharu, the university said following the public appeal for support, the university had extended initial support for the first academic year. &quot;The support will include tuition and hostel fees for one academic year and out of pocket allowances for one academic year,&quot; the letter added.
