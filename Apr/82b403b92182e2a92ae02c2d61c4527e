The electoral agency has directed political parties to comply with timelines that require completion of primaries by April 26. Sunday, during a meeting with electoral officials, some political parties had requested for extension of time to conclude nominations. But the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) directed political parties to complete their nominations within the gazetted time. The commission has also directed political parties to only use their membership list during party primaries. The directive has now dealt a blow to the majority of parties that have been using the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) 2013 register.

The meeting brought together 14 political parties whose officials pressed the commission&#39;s chairman to give a directive on the party-hopping issue. The party-hopping case is still before the court and a ruling is scheduled for May 29. However, the commission has directed its legal team to liaise with the court on the possibility of disposal of the matter on or before April 26. A source who attended the meeting but did not want to be mentioned claimed Jubilee Party wanted an extension of the primaries period for at least a week. However, JP Secretary General Raphael Tuju denied requesting an extension, saying the party would complete the exercise within the stipulated time. Political parties have until May 10 to resolve disputes arising from their primaries. ALSO READ: How Jubilee Party was set to fail right from inception
