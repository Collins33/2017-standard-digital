A Jubilee Party (JP) aspirant for the Mvita parliamentary seat in Mombasa does not even hold a Form Four certificate. Mohamed Salim Mohamed, alias Tenge, admitted he never stepped in secondary school and refuted claims he forged a secondary school certificate. On Monday Tenge said he stopped learning after sitting Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exams at Tom Mboya Primary School in the early 1990s. &ldquo;I never proceeded to secondary school. I dropped out of school in primary after I did my KCPE exams from Tom Mboya. I know my opponents are on a smear campaign and trying to cast me in bad light,&rdquo; said Thenge. But Mohamed said he did not need a high school certificate to be a good leader. &ldquo;I know that all that is required to be a leader is to be of sound mind, articulate in Kiswahili, and have the will of the people,&rdquo; said Tenge.
