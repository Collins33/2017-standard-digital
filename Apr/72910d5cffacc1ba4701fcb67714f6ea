Confusion in Migori County as Ochillo Ayacko announces himself winner of ODM governorship ticket. Incumbent Governor Okoth Obado was earlier announced winner by the Returning Officer beating his closest challenger Ochillo Ayacko in the highly contested nomination exercise. Aspirant Ochillo Ayacko had obtained a court order blocking ODM nomination results. The order stated that the results had been nullified and any further announcement would be an act in futility.&nbsp; Ayacko approached the Appeals Tribunal complaining that the nominations were not being handled in a fair manner. Okoth Obado garnered a total of 110,142 votes against Ochillo Ayacko&rsquo;s 59,449 and Ann Anyanga&#39;s 1,990, according to the Migori County Returning Officer.&nbsp;
