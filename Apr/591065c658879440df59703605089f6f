(Photo: Denish Ochieng/Standard) Maseno School is facing management crisis after the institution&#39;s Board of Management quit. The 11-member board Tuesday announced that it had no business serving following the &#39;questionable&#39; manner in which the Ministry of Education and the Teachers Service Commission has handled issues bedeviling the school. The board&#39;s resignation comes barely four days after TSC interdicted Principal Paul Otula over allegations of sodomy and bullying in the school. Board Chairman Engineer Carey Orege Tuesday said they had made the decisive move after a thorough soul-search, and were convinced that they had exhausted all the avenues of engaging the stakeholders. The reign of the board which has been in place for the last two years was set to come to an end next year.

We have even been threatened with disbandment if we do not approve of the actions taken by the Ministry over the case,&quot; said Orege.
