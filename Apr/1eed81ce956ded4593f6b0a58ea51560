NAIROBI: The&nbsp;major&nbsp;difference&nbsp;between&nbsp;online&nbsp;and&nbsp;offline&nbsp;media&nbsp;is that the&nbsp;former&nbsp;is&nbsp;interactive&nbsp;and&nbsp;thus&nbsp;attractive&nbsp;to (inter)active&nbsp;audiences&nbsp;keen&nbsp;to&nbsp;comment&nbsp;on or&nbsp;participate&nbsp;in&nbsp;conversations&nbsp;about content. Accordingly, newspapers (and other&nbsp;media) in Kenya now have&nbsp;interactive&nbsp;online&nbsp;platforms where readers can critically&nbsp;interact&nbsp;with&nbsp;content&nbsp;and other readers/users, and demonstrate their ability to reason and&nbsp;participate&nbsp;in rational and meaningful discussions. However, the &lsquo;open&rsquo; and &lsquo;free&rsquo; spaces are increasingly becoming sites for hate speech, opprobrium and bigotry.&nbsp;Thus, it is no secret that some of the contributions are notoriously uninformed, uncivil and vituperative and accordingly off-putting to those looking for meaningful engagements and dialogues. Granted, used well, the platforms can be important democratic sites and spaces for sharing views and ideas and aggregating opinions&nbsp;about&nbsp;issues that affect society. Besides, the&nbsp;comments&nbsp;can be vital feedback on the quality of arguments as well as the the (un)popularity and usefulness of opinions and information in the articles. What&rsquo;s more, readers look forward to&nbsp;comments&nbsp;because some offer useful and&nbsp;different&nbsp;perspectives, and&nbsp;thus&nbsp;enhance and enrich the comprehension of issues. This is of course when readers and contributors are rational, knowledgeable and civil and tolerate even views that they may not necessary agree with.

Some&nbsp;media&nbsp;houses have employed moderators to ensure that defamatory, unsubstantiated and unacceptable&nbsp;comments&nbsp;are deleted or not published. However, the struggle&nbsp;between&nbsp;control or moderation and freedom in such&nbsp;online&nbsp;spaces is becoming conspicuous particularly in an era when freedom of expression is cherished as a fundamental human right. Defamatory statements Granted, it is an oft-accepted view that freedom of expression is never absolute and that boundaries should be set and respected. And those boundaries are often clear in&nbsp;comment&nbsp;policies. The Standard&rsquo;s&nbsp;comment&nbsp;policy states, under the &lsquo;No libel or other abuse&rsquo; requirement, that contributors &ldquo;must not make or encourage&nbsp;comments&nbsp;which are: defamatory, false or misleading; insulting, threatening or abusive; obscene or of a sexual nature; offensive, racist, sexist, homophobic or discriminatory against any religions or other groups&rsquo;. The Star&rsquo;s policy indicates that &lsquo;unwarranted personal abuse and defamatory statements will be deleted; strong personal criticism is acceptable if justified by facts and arguments; and, deviation from points of discussion may lead to deletion of&nbsp;comments.&rsquo; Irrespective of these warnings, the sites often have&nbsp;comments&nbsp;that are unacceptable, defamatory, offensive, abusive and obscene. This rubbishes the policies, and demonstrates the inability to moderate discussions and make them meaningful and the space a platform where people can engage rationally. The Nation did away with user&nbsp;comment&nbsp;below their stories because they could perhaps not afford to moderate reader commentary or postings. Peter Mwaura, the Nation&rsquo;s Public Editor argued that many readers and potential&nbsp;commentators&nbsp;are &ldquo;withdrawing from the&nbsp;comment&nbsp;platform because some members of the community engage in toxic&nbsp;comments, insults, off-topic personal attacks&rdquo;. ALSO READ: Architects training in jeopardy There are notorious&nbsp;commenters&nbsp;who do not care&nbsp;about&nbsp;their writings knowing that the Internet will perhaps protect their identities and make it difficult for them to be held accountable. It is clear that they cannot repeat their statements in&nbsp;offline&nbsp;discussions or spaces. Hiding behind pseudo-names For example, the story in The Star&nbsp;about&nbsp;Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s education at Amherst College in the U.S headlined &ldquo;Curious&rsquo; Kenyans task Amherst College to clarify Uhuru&rsquo;s degree status&rsquo;. It was hugely &lsquo;popular&rsquo; based on the number of&nbsp;comments. By Friday morning, it had more than 440&nbsp;comments. Ideally, the number of&nbsp;comments&nbsp;should show the level of interest in, and popularity of the story. And that story was anything but. Some of the&nbsp;comments&nbsp;are clearly unpalatable, offensive and defamatory, and violate the paper&rsquo;s policy.&nbsp;Comments&nbsp;by people going by such names as Baaaaaaba, Jaluo mjinga, Mbiyu wa Mgambo, and Indiazi demonstrate their incapacity to either respect the policies or post meaningful&nbsp;comments. Those names alone show that they are hiding behind pseudo-names because they do not want to be held accountable. The baneful consequences of trolling, opprobrium and making defamatory&nbsp;comments&nbsp;can be devastating not only to the subject and victim but also to the credibility of the publication. Accordingly, as the The Star has failed to moderate the platform, it should perhaps prepare for the consequences. As indicated above, defamatory, scandalous, offensive and unpalatable&nbsp;comments/commentaries even in an era of freedom of expression is unacceptable, and serious&nbsp;media&nbsp;houses know that the forum, however popular in the short term, would be perilous not only to their long-term credibility and reputation, but also bottom line.
