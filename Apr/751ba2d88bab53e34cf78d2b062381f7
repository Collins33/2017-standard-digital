LODWAR: Tension is high along the Kenya-South Sudan border border point following the killing of 11 people in renewed clashes between Turkana herders and Sudanese Toposa militia. The clashes were ignited by 100 heavily armed Toposa militia who raided a village in Mogila on Monday afternoon. According to the Turkana West sub-county commissioner, the locals, who appeared to have prior information of the raid, waylaid the attackers and engaged them in a fierce gun fight that lasted more than six hours. &ldquo;They ambushed the raiders and shot dead nine of the attackers. Two Turkana herders were shot dead before the raiders escaped with dozens of cattle towards the border point,&rdquo; Mr Dara said. Mr Dara said the raiders managed to escape with an unknown number of cattle towards the South Sudan border, located about 20km from Lokichoggio town.
