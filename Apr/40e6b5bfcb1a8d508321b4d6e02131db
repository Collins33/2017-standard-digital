Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto has refuted claims by Deputy President William Ruto that he was out to divide the Kalenjin community in Rift Valley saying that instead he was fighting for their rights. The Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) party leader who spoke at Olmekenyu in Narok South said the DP only initiated development in his North Rift backyard while isolating the Kipsigis. &quot;I have heard him (DP Ruto) claim that I am dividing the Kalenjin. I want to say that I am not dividing anybody but I&rsquo;m championing for their rights,&quot; said Governor Ruto. He cited the Mau forest complex issue saying the DP failed to address it despite him promising to do so severally. The CCM leader said for the last four years, Mau settlers were yet to be issued with title deeds or compensation since Jubilee took over power. &quot;The DP went to Nairobi and forgot about the Mau forest issue. The other day, he said that the caveat was going to be lifted yet they do not come out clear,&quot; said Ruto.

They have a short memory,&quot; said Ruto. Ruto said the Kipsigis were at liberty to vote anybody as long as he/she will be ready to make agreements on the interests of the community.
