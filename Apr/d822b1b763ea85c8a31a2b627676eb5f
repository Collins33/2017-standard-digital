NAIROBI: Workers&#39; boss Francis Atwoli wants the minimum wage for workers increased from Sh12,600 to Sh15,372 a month. Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU-K) secretary general said reviewing salaries up by 22 per cent would ensure efficiency and better lifestyle for the workers. &quot;When the economy is not growing, the Government should put up mechanisms to ensure its people are not starving and one of the ways is to improve remuneration for workers,&quot; Mr Atwoli said. He attributed the high cost of living to poor governance and called for more controlled measures to curb the situation. &quot;Everywhere you go in the country, Kenyans are crying over high cost of living and unemployment. It is the high time that people in Government should put heads together and come up with a lasting solution to the challenges affecting Kenyans,&quot; he said. Atwoli criticised the Government for allowing civil servants to engage in politics. &quot;Civil servants are supposed to serve Kenyans and are not in office for the interest of a few people in Government,&quot; he said adding, &quot;If they are to engage in politics, the best solution is to quit their positions and pursue other interests but not both.&quot; He said Cotu could support Jubilee&#39;s re-election on condition matters affecting workers are heard and acted upon on or before May 1. &quot;This is our prayer that we want President Uhuru to heed to. Workers are tired of manipulation and false promises. We need action now,&quot; he said. He further called for responsible campaigns in a bid to avoid a repeat of the 2007/2008 post-election violence. &quot;Elections are good but if they will lead to bloodshed, we better do without them,&quot; he said adding, &quot;Leaders should be responsible with their utterances especially during campaigns.&quot;
