Party of National Unity&#39;s (PNU) primaries conducted over the weekend in parts of Meru and Embu counties were largely peaceful. However, in Maua Ward, the sitting MCA and his challenger disagreed over the mode of nomination. When the ballot papers were delivered at Kilalai Primary School polling station, Boniface Mwirigi who is challenging the incumbent Duncan Kangwana, refused to take part in the exercise, claiming the election was rigged in favour of Mr Kangwana. PNU&#39;s National Elections Board Chairman Hosea Mutembei yesterday told The Standard the Senate and parliamentary tickets had already been decided as a result of consensus among the aspirants. &quot;The aspirants sat down and agreed to leave the seat to one person after gauging their chances. That is why most of the nominations were for MCAs only,&quot; Mr Mutembei said. Apart from Maua Ward where some ballot papers were destroyed, other areas were calm, although turnout was poor. Most of the sitting MCAs who are seeking re-election on the Governor Peter Munya-led Party were &quot;unopposed&quot;.

County Secretary Julius Kimathi is PNU&#39;s Imenti Central parliamentary candidate as he seeks to send the incumbent, Mr Mwiti Irea, home. Munya&#39;s Co-operatives, Trade and Tourism Executive, Ntoitha Mithiaru, will seek to recapture the Igembe North seat which he held between 2008 and 2013. Lawyer Mugambi Imanyara, the party&#39;s Senate candidate, attributed the low turnout to consensus among aspirants. He said PNU had 600 aspirants but consensus led to many getting tickets without having to go to polls.
