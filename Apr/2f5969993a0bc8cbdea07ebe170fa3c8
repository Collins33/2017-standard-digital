Former Law Society of Kenya chairman Eric Mutua has lost to a former permanent secretary in the battle for the Mwingi Central Wiper parliamentary ticket. However, Mr Mutua, who garnered 3,587 votes against former Housing and Public works PS Gideon Mulyungi&#39;s 11,676, dismissed the nominations as a sham. Addressing journalists in Mwingi town yesterday after the announcement, Mutua said most voters from Nuu and Mui wards did not vote as ballot papers arrived late. &quot;The election in Mwingi Central Constituency was a total sham and a big joke. The Wiper national elections board should not even wait for me to petition but it should nullify the purported results and call for a repeat exercise,&quot; Mutua said. The lawyer claimed most presiding officers were &quot;picked from the streets&quot; on the election day, &quot;opening the possibility for manipulation and vote rigging&quot;. Mutua added that should the board fail to cancel the results, he would move to court. &quot;We have remedies for this sham election. One of them is to move to court and seek nullification of the entire results and that means Wiper will not have a candidate in the constituency. Both Mulyungi and myself will contest as independent candidates,&quot; he said.

We will counter his petition and stop him in his tracks,&quot; he said.
