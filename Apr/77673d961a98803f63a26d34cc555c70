An Italian was on Tuesday arraigned in a Malindi court to answer charges of being in Kenya illegally and issuing bad cheques. Guiseppe Fabiano Bocus, 59, pleaded not guilty to the charges before Principal Magistrate Silvia Wewa and was released on bond. According to the charge sheet, Mr Guiseppe is alleged to have issued three bouncing cheques for Sh720,000 to Gaetano Grasso on his account number 0218783001 at Diamond trust bank, Malindi branch. The accused, who does not understand English, was assisted by a translator to understand the charges. Guiseppe is also accused of lacking the necessary documents to be in the country, and as such, being in Kenya illegally. The court released him on a Sh20,000 bond with a Kenyan surety of a similar amount. ALSO READ: Italy's Scarponi killed in training crash The case will be heard on June 20, 2017. Malindi and Mombasa have a large Italian population. While most of them are law-abiding and engage in legitimate commerce in entertainment, casino and hotel trade, some even acquiring Kenyan citizenship, a number have found themselves on the wrong side of the law. A few have been involved in crime and deported or charged. Early this month, Mario Pele and Leone Alberto Fulvio were deported to Italy after claims they were fugitives from justice in their country.&nbsp;
