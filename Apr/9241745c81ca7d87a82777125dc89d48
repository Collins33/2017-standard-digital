A Kanu gubernatorial and a parliamentary candidate have warned their Jubilee rivals to brace themselves for a tough battle. In their individual statements to the press, Jonah Keter, who wants to vie for governor, and Belgut parliamentary aspirant Raymond Cheruiyot said Kericho residents were disillusioned with the Jubilee government and were ready to back Kanu. Keter may find himself running against whoever clinches the Jubilee gubernatorial ticket who include the incumbent, Dr Paul Chepkwony, former National Social Security Fund Managing Trustee Richard Langat, Ainamoi MP Benjamin Langat and Kenya Ports Authority Director Eng Fred Kirui. The other aspirant Cheruiyot, who is CEO of Accfin East Africa Limited, may be up against incumbent Erik Keter and Nelson Koech, a Nairobi-based businessman who is the son in-law of former South Rift political kingpin Kipkalya Kones. Keter said his mission will be to rebuild the county&#39;s economy. &quot;Value addition of tea must be done in Kericho and the county given credit for its quality tea,&quot; said Keter. And Cheruiyot said, &quot;The construction of school libraries in all learning institutions is one of the first things I will do if elected area legislator.&quot; ALSO READ: Tough, swift action only way to deter poll violence
