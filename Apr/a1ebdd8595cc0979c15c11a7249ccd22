Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i has criticised the Judiciary over the thriving cases of fake academic papers in the country. Dr Matiang&rsquo;i said the Judiciary had been giving holders of bogus papers the opportunity to get jobs. Speaking at St Mary&rsquo;s Yala Boys High School in Siaya County during a visit to a number of institutions in the area, Matiang&rsquo;i challenged the Judiciary to be firm and play a just role in providing solutions on fake academic papers. &ldquo;I have much respect for the Judiciary as an independent arm of the Government, but they need to be part of the solution to this problem. You cannot provide hideouts for quacks,&rdquo; said Matiang&rsquo;i. According to the CS, most people with fake academic certificates had taken advantage of the Judiciary, where they rush to seek court orders to be allowed to secure opportunities using the questionable qualifications. He said the forgiveness of qualifications was a recipe for corruption and impunity, which has bedevilled the country. The CS&rsquo;s comments came amid increased cases of forgery of academic papers with Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, MP Oscar Sudi and Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu having been challenged over the authenticity of their academic papers.
