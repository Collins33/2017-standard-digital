The government needs to rethink about how it handles insecurity in violence-prone counties,&nbsp; Meru governor Peter Munya has said. Besides increasing funding to equip security agencies, officers may need to be retrained, particularly if they have been deployed to the volatile grazing zones in Baringo, Laikipia, Meru/Isiolo border and Samburu, Mr Munya noted. Speaking during the commissioning the Sh123 million Meru Water and Sewerage treatment plant, the governor said insecurity was payalysing economic activity in some counties. &ldquo;In the past we used to think it was a problem of numbers, but it is now apparent that even after heavy recruitment in the last few years, security has remained a challenge in troubled areas. It is therefore probably about equipment, training or strategy,&rdquo; said Munya. He added: &ldquo;On the Meru/Isiolo border, the security problem has not improved&nbsp; and people have moved out of their homes to camp near police stations in places like Ndumuru in Igembe North,&rdquo; said Munya.

In Meru County,&nbsp; the national government will soon embark on the construction of&nbsp; three&nbsp; dams at Kianjuri in Buuri, Thangatha in Tigania East and Ura dam in Igembe Central, he noted.
