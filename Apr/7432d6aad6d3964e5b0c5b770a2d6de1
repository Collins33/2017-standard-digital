Human rights groups held a peaceful protest to condemn rising cases of violence against women aspirants. The youthful aspirants joined Ripples International, Kenya National Human Rights Commission, Federation of Women Lawyers and Youth Agenda to condemn electoral and other forms of violence that may deter women from participating in the upcoming primaries. Led by Eunice Wambui, who is eyeing Embakasi South Parliamentary seat, the aspirants marched from Makaburini area near Nairobi&rsquo;s Nyayo Stadium to the 7th August Memorial Park. Wambui was attacked by a group of rowdy youths three months ago when she went to campaign at Mukuru Kwa Reuben. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was hit by a piece of wood with traces of nails. My car was smashed and the windows broken,&rdquo; she said. Youth Agenda chief executive Susan Mwongera said&nbsp;men must shun violence to level the political playground so that women can aggressively seek elective seats. Kenyans go to the polls on August 8 in an exercise billed as the most competitive.&nbsp;
