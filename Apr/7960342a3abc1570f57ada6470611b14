A 34-year-old man hacked his wife to death over suspicion she was having an affair with a boda boda cyclist. The assailant is said to have picked a quarrel with the wife, Beatrice Muthoni, 33, after he found her with the alleged lover. The incident took place in Kaweru village soon after the couple returned home from visiting their parents. Their close associates said the visit was to help them solve their domestic squabbles. Ms Muthoni was reportedly found seated on a motor cycle belonging to a man whom the husband suspected she was having an affair with. Residents claimed that the man&#39;s suspicions were based on rumours that the 33-year-old woman was having an illicit relationship with the rider, something she denied. A neighbour, Peter Mwaura, told The Standard that shortly after 1am, there was commotion in the couple&#39;s house before all went quite. In the morning, they found the man had killed his wife by slitting her throat with a kitchen knife.
