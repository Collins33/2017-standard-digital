Kitui Governor Julius Malombe on Friday cautioned Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka not to be too quick to forge a political alliance with Narc party leader Charity Ngilu. Mr Malombe claimed Ngilu was mischievous and dishonest in her quest to support Kalonzo&rsquo;s presidential ambition. The governor dismissed the former Water Cabinet Secretary as a traitor and dangerous for pretending to support Kalonzo only to advance her quest to be elected as Kitui governor in the August elections. &ldquo;Ngilu&rsquo;s body language betrays her. She is not genuine. She wants to use Kalonzo&rsquo;s name to clinch the gubernatorial seat and then turn back to her former self,&rdquo; Malombe said. Speaking when he launched the Ikutha Level 4 Hospital in Kitui South constituency, Malombe said if Ngilu was honest and sincere in safeguarding Kalonzo&rsquo;s political destiny, she should have abandoned her party and joined Wiper to fight from within. Hatched plot Malombe further said Senator David Musila was working in cahoots with Ngilu to disfranchise Wiper Party and lock him out of the party nominations.

They are forging a working relationship to ensure they unseat me. But this will not work,&rdquo; the governor said. He said he believes Kalonzo stands to lose in the unfolding political scenario. Musila, the Wiper party chairman, is among those politicians who have publicly stated that they would seek Wiper&rsquo;s nomination to contest the Kitui governorship. Ms Ngilu has also declared that she would vie for the governorship on her Narc party ticket.
