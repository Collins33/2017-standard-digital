Campuses of two Kenyan public universities are facing closure after Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i instructed Commission for University Education (CUE) to asses their viability. Dr Matiang&#39;i also instructed the university councils of Kenyatta University and Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology (JKUAT) to act on the matter. CUE chairperson Prof Chacha Nyaigotti Chacha Monday said his office has received an official communication from the ministry concerning the two campuses. &quot;We wish not to disclose how we are going on with the matter at this stage and so kindly leave it at that,&quot; said Prof Chacha. Sources, however, revealed to&nbsp;The Standard&nbsp;that the fate of the campuses is already sealed and they are set for closure. Speaking yesterday during an induction workshop for newly-appointed public university council members, Matiang&#39;i said one of the universities fraudulently lost Sh400 million.

There is a level of recklessness that we cannot live with. And this must come to an end,&quot; Matiang&#39;i said. He said senior ministry staff were shocked to learn that the council of the said university was not aware of their approval on setting up the Kigali campus. &quot;We were shocked when they confessed they were not aware. Councils operating campuses outside Kenya must now review them with CUE to ascertain whether there is a case for continuation,&quot; said Matiang&#39;i.
