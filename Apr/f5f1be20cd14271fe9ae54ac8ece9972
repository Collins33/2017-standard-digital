The High Court in Malindi has extended the duration for political parties to carry out nominations following an application by Non-Government Organization. The court allowed parties up to May 1 to conduct their primaries pending hearing of the application filed by Angaza Empowerment Network. &ldquo;It is directed that all political parties are at liberty to continue with their primaries up to and including May 1 pending the hearing of the application,&rdquo; said Justice Weldon Korir. Angaza Empowerment Network filed the application, only a day after the Independent Electoral and Boundary Commission (IEBC) declined to push the deadline from Wednesday. On Sunday, the electoral agency had directed political parties to comply with timelines that require completion of primaries by April 26, after some parties requested for a review of the timeline. Monday morning, the lobby group through the law firm Mbugua, Atudo and Macharia advocates, lodged the case before Justice Korir who certified the application as urgent.

He accused IEBC of slashing the period to conduct the party primaries by ten days and asked the High Court to order the commission to extend the period from April 26 to May 7. &ldquo;My organisation has been monitoring the nomination exercise currently underway with increasing concern and alarm.&nbsp; All parties have experienced serious problems and difficulties in conducting the elections which the media has described as chaotic, shambolic, beset with numerous logistical challenges, affected by violence and electoral malpractices,&rdquo; the affidavit reads. IEBC is listed as the sole respondent.
