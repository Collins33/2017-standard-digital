A prison officer in Eldoret was Saturday accidentally shot dead by a colleague. The deceased had allegedly attempted to intervene in a domestic row. Eldoret East OCPD Adamson Furaha said the officer had accompanied a colleague to arrest a man over a booked report but met resistance from locals. &quot;Preliminary findings indicate four prison officers were repelled by the public, afraid they would be overpowered, one officer shot in the air once. He fired to disperse the public for the second time but due to the push and pull with residents he fell and the bullet hit the officer,&quot; said Furaha. The body was taken to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital Mortuary.&nbsp;
