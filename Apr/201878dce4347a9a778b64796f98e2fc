Hollywood actress Lupita Nyong&rsquo;o has endorsed her father for the Kisumu County governorship. The Oscar winner&nbsp;said Kisumu will be better off with Senator Anyang Nyong&rsquo;o as governor. &ldquo;I know for certain that Kisumu will be a better place and leap into the future with you steering it. I am proud of my hometown Kisumu. That is why I featured Vogue magazine there last year,&rdquo; she said in a video she termed as an open letter to her father. She extolled the Kisumu Senator as a fighter whose unwavering passion for cultivating a better future for Kenya even when it was a thankless task, she had witnessed. &ldquo;Even when it was a threat to your life, you have never given up. You continue pushing for change and development,&rdquo; she said in a passionate appeal to Kisumu voters. She noted that since Prof Nyong&rsquo;o supports the arts, Kisumu will benefit from his leadership.
