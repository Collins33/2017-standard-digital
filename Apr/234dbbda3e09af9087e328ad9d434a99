Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has supported calls by National Assembly Minority Leader Francis Nyenze that NASA should name its flag-bearer. &quot;Nyenze is within his constitutional right to make any pronouncement and should not be vilified for airing his opinion. After all, other leaders have made similar statements,&quot; Kalonzo said. Nyenze&#39;s seven-day ultimatum last week for NASA to name its flag bearer has ignited debate, especially in ODM. Nyenze also told the coalition&#39;s National Coordinating Committee to convene a National Executive Council meeting and declare Kalonzo the presidential candidate, sentiments he repeated Wednesday. Kalonzo said he was optimistic that Wiper would reclaim the Machakos gubernatorial seat.&nbsp;
