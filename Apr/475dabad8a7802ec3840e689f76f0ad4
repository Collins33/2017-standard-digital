Opposition leaders Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi want ODM Secretary General Agnes Zani to apologise publicly for her remarks over a leaked report on the Opposition&#39;s presidential candidate. The two maintained they were yet to agree on the National Super Alliance (NASA) presidential candidate. &quot;Nothing is agreed until we agree. We are yet to agree. The statement by Senator Agnes Zani should be withdrawn,&quot; said Kalonzo. Wednesday, Mudavadi drove to Kalonzo&#39;s Wiper headquarters in Lavington, Nairobi, for talks that lasted about 10 minutes. A source who declined to be named, however, said the two, together with Ford-Kenya leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula, could have hatched a plot to have Raila endorse them since he has contested in previous elections and failed. The source divulged that Mudavadi and Kalonzo could have discussed ways to push Raila to step down for either a Mudavadi-Kalonzo or a Kalonzo-Mudavadi ticket to face President Uhuru Kenyatta.

Since the last election, Wetang&#39;ula, who is the Senate Minority Leader, has been cosy with Kalonzo and now with the entry of Mudavadi, Raila seems to be the target. &quot;They want to push &#39;Tinga&#39; to the wall to endorse one of them. Their argument is that they have supported Raila and he failed. It is time he reciprocated and supported one of them,&quot; said the source. At the height of a protracted NASA presidential ticket battle, the duo are said to be raising their stake, with Kalonzo stating categorically that time was of the essence. &quot;That report leaked out in the form that the media presented. A few aspects and figures were not from the committee but the line-up presented had been agreed by the committee,&quot; Ms Zani said on Tuesday. Working documents In a hard-hitting statement, Mudavadi&#39;s Amani National Congress party said ODM&#39;s confession left no doubt about where leaks of working documents have been coming from. &quot;ANC reiterates that its representatives are not aware of a formal report for the attention of and shared with the principals on the matter of flag bearer,&quot; read the ANC statement signed by Secretary General Godfrey Osotsi.

People have expressed different opinions but that will not cause us to break,&quot; he said. [email&#160;protected]
