A&nbsp;scramble&nbsp;to&nbsp;endorse&nbsp;political&nbsp;aspirants&nbsp;has&nbsp;caused&nbsp;a&nbsp;major&nbsp;split&nbsp;among&nbsp;elders&nbsp;in the&nbsp;region. Several&nbsp;elders&rsquo; factions have emerged with each side claiming to be the legitimate outfit to confer&nbsp;political&nbsp;endorsement. Th&nbsp;elders&nbsp;are in a rush to&nbsp;endorse&nbsp;aspirants&nbsp;for various seats ahead of the the Orange Democratic Movement nominations, which are scheduled from March 7-23. In Kisumu, the primaries will be held on March 13. Tuesday, a faction of the&nbsp;elders&nbsp;led by Charles Kogada dismissed rival factions that have&nbsp;endorsed&nbsp;various candidates claiming that a number of&nbsp;elders&nbsp;were not genuine and were only interested in cash handouts. &lsquo;Blessing&rsquo;&nbsp;aspirants Various&nbsp;elders&nbsp;groupings have been holding several meetings across the county to &lsquo;bless&rsquo;&nbsp;aspirants.

Over the weekend, three governor&nbsp;aspirants&nbsp;received the blessings of various&nbsp;elders&nbsp;from 11 clans in Nyakach with all the factions&nbsp;endorsing&nbsp;their respective bids. Prof Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o, Dr Hezron MacObewa and Chris Ondiek&nbsp;all sought the blessings of&nbsp;elders&nbsp;from different clans in Nyakach in a bid to mobilise support at the grassroots. Both Nyong&rsquo;o and Ondiek met different factions of&nbsp;elders&nbsp;from the larger Kadiang&rsquo;a clan in different events with both claiming that they have already sealed the Nyakach vote. The duo met&nbsp;elders&nbsp;in Seme too while campaigning in the area to market a pact they have formed to help unseat Ranguma. Weekend meetings Over the weekend, McObewa, met a section of&nbsp;elders&nbsp;and the youth at Sang&rsquo;oro and Katito where they said they would back his bid hours after he had met&nbsp;elders&nbsp;from Ombeyi in the larger Kano clan who&nbsp;endorsed&nbsp;his bid.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Wrangles over ODM County Election Board puts primaries in jeopardy Ranguma&rsquo;s reelection&nbsp;has&nbsp;also gotten the backing of faction of&nbsp;elders&nbsp;from all various clans, including those from the larger Kano, Kisumo, Seme and Nyakach. Tuesday, the Charles Kogada faction who announced support for Ranguma, insisted it was the only legitimate group. &ldquo;Recently, three&nbsp;elders&nbsp;discredited the decision by over 3,000&nbsp;elders. It is their democratic right but the same democracy demands that the few have their say while the&nbsp;majority&nbsp;have their way,&rdquo; said Kogada.
