Jubilee aspirants have asked the party to ensure that only the strongest candidate among them clinches the ticket. National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso (pictured) will face National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation board chairman Julius Kones in the primaries. The winner of the April 21 party nominations will be locked in a tough race against the incumbent, Governor Isaac Ruto, who is the Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) party leader. Whoever manages to dislodge Mr Ruto will literally have delivered victory to Deputy President William Ruto and Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter, who have sworn to floor the governor in the August elections. &ldquo;The stakes involved in this nomination are high. All energy must be geared towards ensuring that the process is above board. I will not accept a situation where somebody is playing games because the people of Bomet have shown their confidence in me and I am expecting a win,&rdquo; said Dr Laboso. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Row emerges on composition of ODM's election board
