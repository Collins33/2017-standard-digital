&nbsp; NAIROBI: Gumboots have become must-have items for the residents of Pipeline estate. It is the only way one can navigate the muddy roads if one does not want to pay exorbitant boda boda fares. Every election year, aspirants promise better roads but this is soon forgotten once they are voted into office. &quot;Aspiring leaders have been promising to build good roads but once elections are over, it is forgotten,&quot; says Thomas Wambugu, a resident of Pipeline. The road project started in Wimasi but stalled, leaving deep gullies. Pipeline ward MCA Samuel Kagiri blames the county roads executive for not releasing the funds required to tarmac the roads.

I have done my best; I have gone to his office several times,&quot; says Mr Kagiri. &quot;We even did the tendering and mapping of the roads all the way from Kware to Tumaini Supermarket to join the already tarmacked section from Pipeline (matatu) stage, but the funds have not been released,&quot; he adds. Garbage disposal Matters are made worse by the lack of proper garbage disposal systems, which forces residents to throw their trash on the roads. The worst section is along Plot 10 down to Kware. And boda boda operators have taken advantage of the situation to overcharge people. Pipeline estate chairman John Odinga, who also serves as a village elder, noted the polluted air residents are breathing in daily.

The air is bad and I don&#39;t know what health officers would say if they happened to visit,&quot; says Mr Odinga. &quot;If such conditions continue, there is a high likelihood of diseases like cholera and typhoid breaking out,&quot; he adds.
