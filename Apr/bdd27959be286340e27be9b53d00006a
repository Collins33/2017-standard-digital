Are you an owl? A night owl, that is. You like to watch movies long into the evening, and then you struggle to get up for work? Well, science says you&#39;re probably more intelligent and creative. You might even be happier. Don&#39;t feel guilty about that lie-in. A new study entitled &quot;Why Night Owls Are More Intelligent&quot; illustrates that being in control of when you sleep, and when you wake up, means you&#39;re clever. Authors Satoshi Kanazawa and Kaja Perina say that being able to hit the &#39;snooze&#39; button on your alarm clock means you&#39;re quite possibly an intellectual, because you&#39;ve adapted to modern life. Alarms are a relatively new invention. There&#39;s that rule, isn&#39;t there: get up as soon as your alarm sounds. Well, being able to follow you intuition and sleep a little longer indicates the urge to follow your ambitions. Kanazawa and Perina suggest that doing so makes you more independent and free. A similar study by the University of Southampton analysed 1,229 people and their socioeconomic situations &ndash; and found a distinct correlation with sleeping patterns. People who go to bed after 11pm and get up after 8am generally earned more money and had a better lifestyle. But remember &ndash; sleeping for too little or too long isn&#39;t a good idea. It is advised that adults should get between seven and nine hours of sleep a night. &nbsp;
