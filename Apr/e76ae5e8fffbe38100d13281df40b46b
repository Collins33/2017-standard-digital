The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret is reported to have conducted its first cornea transplant last Wednesday. More importantly, the hospital has plans to set up an eye bank, a hitherto unknown concept. This would be a major step towards managing the growing spectre of eye infections. The cornea, described as the clear window of the eye, is susceptible to a disease scientifically known as Keratoconus that affects one in every 2,000 people. Managing it early is important in maintaining good vision. Such medical advances keep in line with Government pledges to make better and advanced healthcare easily accessible to all locally. In due course, the many trips, often too expensive that patients make outside Kenya in search of treatment, would lessen. In November last year, two conjoined twins, Blessings and Favour, were successfully separated at the Kenyatta National Hospital, yet this is something that was unimaginable only a few years back. Before, such a delicate operation would have seen the family of the twins go through the rigorous process of raising millions of shillings for treatment either in South Africa or India. With the right effort, dedication, attention and resources to aid in research, there is a lot more the country can achieve. ALSO READ: Busia doctors and nurses vow to stay away from dirty wards
