There was a slow start for Jubilee primaries in Meru this morning but the exercise has so far kicked on. All stations visited by the Standard team were yet to start the exercise by 9.30 am because there was delay in distribution of election materials. In Meru town, voting first started at Mohamed Moti polling station in town centre after 9.30 am. Crowds of voters had been milling there since 6.00 am but election officials said they were still waiting for materials to arrive although they had been stored at the local Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCIO) strong room less than a kilometer away from the station. At Kianjai, Muthara and Karama markets in Tigania East and at Kangeta in Igembe Central, voters were already waiting for election officials and materials by 8.00 am. According to JP Meru branch secretary Alhajji Mwendia, 130 contestants are contending for the 57 tickets that are up for grabs in the primaries.
