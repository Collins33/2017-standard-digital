Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto has laughed off Jubilee Party&rsquo;s failed primaries, saying it is an indicator that even its leaders cannot be trusted to deliver free and fair election. &ldquo;Jubilee is not able to conduct its own primaries. How can we trust it to guarantee Kenyans a free and fair election?&rdquo; he posed. The Governor spoke at Bomet Green Stadium when he unveiled CCM nominees in the just concluded primaries yesterday. His supporters accorded him a heroic welcome after joining NASA as a co-principal. Governor Ruto said he does not regret cutting links with Jubilee saying his exit spelled doomed for the ruling coalition. &ldquo;The confusion in Jubilee is as a result of my departure. I am the one who has all the ideas and plans to succeed. It will be an uphill task to penetrate and sell its candidates in the coming polls,&rdquo; Ruto added. CCM supporters hailed him for the bold move.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Jubilee Party cancels nominations
