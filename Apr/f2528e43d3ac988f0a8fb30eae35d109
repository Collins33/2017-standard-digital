A fresh political battle between Senator Hassan Omar and Governor Hassan Joho erupted Thursday. Mr Omar, who is eyeing Mr Joho&#39;s seat in the August 8 polls, called for further investigations into the governor&#39;s academic credentials. In a separate forum, Joho accused his rivals of working for his downfall, saying he had however managed to rise from his humble background. Joho and the senator, who were allies for two years after the 2013 polls, have become bitter rivals lately, with Omar launching a tirade of criticism against the governor. Omar said Jubilee&#39;s &quot;obsession with Joho&quot;, was whipping up resident&#39;s emotions.
