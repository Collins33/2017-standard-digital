NASA Principal Musalia Mudavadi has asked those complaining about their line-up to sacrifice personal ambitions for the sake of the country. Mudavadi who is the founder of coalition said those making noise are playing to the Jubilee den. &quot;I ask our supporters and every Kenyan to give NASA a little of&nbsp;themselves for the sake of all of us. We must give meaning to Kenya Kwanza (Kenya first),&quot; he told Sunday Standard. His comments come in the wake of a campaign by Jubilee mocking the choice of flag bearer by the coalition and tension in Wiper. Officials from the Wiper held a meeting in Nairobi on Friday night in a bid to stem rising rebellion within its ranks. Nevertheless, Mudavadi is confident of a round one win come August.&nbsp;
