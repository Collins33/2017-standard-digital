A wedding at a church in Mathira constituency was interrupted when a woman claiming to be the groom&rsquo;s wife stormed the venue. Lydia Mugure went to Kanyama PCEA Church with her children on Saturday claiming that the groom, George Kiragu, was her husband. She claimed they had been married for 10 years and that he had fathered her two children. Police were called in to restore order and they threw Ms Mugure out as Mr Kiragu and his bride took their vows under guard. Mugure accused the church of ignoring her objection and conducting an illegal wedding. She alleged the bride was an employee of the church. But the presiding minister maintained that the church had not received any written notice as required to stop the wedding.
