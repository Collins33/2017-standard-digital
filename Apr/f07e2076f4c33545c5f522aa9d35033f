NAIROBI: Double world record holder Daniel Komen was Monday charged with forgery. Mr Komen,&nbsp;who is a two mile and 3000 metres indoor and outdoor champion, appeared before Resident Magistrate Christine Njagi and denied six counts of forgery and obtaining money by false pretences. Komen, who in 1997 bagged gold for Kenya in the IAAF World championships in Athens in 5,000 meters, was accused that in 2013 at Nakumatt Junction, he obtained a vehicle, a Suzuki Escudo worth Sh1.75 million, from Thomas Getanguta, by pretending that he was in a position to pay for it. In the second count, the accused was said to have forged a motor vehicle sale agreement of a Suzuki escudo from him to Nicholas Odhiambo while purporting it to be genuine in September 2015. He was again accused of uttering a false document to Cecilia Muthoni. Komen (right) is said to have again forged an acknowledgement letter of receipt of Sh780,000 dated December 2014 purporting it to be a genuine acknowledgement of cash received from Mr Odhiambo. In count six Komen was charged with issuing a bouncing cheque on May 28, 2014, where he reportedly gave a cheque of Sh300,000 from his CFC Stanbic Account to Odhiambo, when he knew that it had insufficient funds. He denied all the charges and was freed on a Sh500,000 bond or a Sh300,000 cash bail.
