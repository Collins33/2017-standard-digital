Keiyo South MP Jackson Kiptanui has petitioned the Jubilee Party tribunal to nullify nominations results. Mr Kiptanui, who was seeking a ticket to vie for the governorship, claimed the exercise was marred by malpractices. Kiptanui was beaten by the incumbent, Governor Alex Tolgos. He claimed county officials acted as presiding officers and manipulated the vote in favour of the governor. He also alleged extensive voter bribery and intimidation of his agents. However, Mr Tolgos said the polls were free and fair and dismissed reports of malpractice. &quot;I won fairly and I am welcoming my competitors to join me in developing the county,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
