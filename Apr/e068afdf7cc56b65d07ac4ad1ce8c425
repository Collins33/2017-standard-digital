A woman senatorial aspirant, Sheila Githaiga, on Tuesday escaped unhurt after a group of youths attacked her campaign motorcade near Bellevue in Kieni West. Ms Githaiga together with her husband, Kibuka, were on the campaign trail to woo voters ahead of Friday&#39;s Jubilee Party primaries. Speaking at Mweiga Police Station, the couple blamed the attack on their rivals.&nbsp; &quot;I suspect this has been planned by my political opponents keen on intimidating and silencing me into dropping out of the race,&quot; the aspirant explained. She is contesting for Jubilee Party ticket and will face off with Daniel Wamahiu and Ephraim Maina at the primaries. The incident brings to two the number of women aspirants who have been attacked in the county after a similar attack on Tetu parliamentary aspirant Anne Kanyi. Ms Kanyi escaped death last week following an attack by four masked men. ALSO READ: Jubilee aspirants panicking over list of preferred candidates
