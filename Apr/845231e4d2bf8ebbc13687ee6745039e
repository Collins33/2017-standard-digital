The police are looking for a man said to have been collecting money from locals pretending he will secure them jobs in the county government. The man claimed he was a Government employee. He is said to have conned youths in Muvau, Kaumoni and Wote.&nbsp; Area OCPD Bosita Omukolongolo said they swung into action after receiving complaints that a man was asking for between Sh2,000 and Sh5,000 to give them State jobs. &quot;I can&#39;t tell how many people have been conned. However, I am calling on them to record statements with us,&quot; Omukolongolo said. Emily Mwangangi, 19, from Muvau village, said she came to know the suspect through the area chief. She said the chief told her the man had a ready job for her. &quot;I thought it was a clean deal because the chief was involved. The man later called me and asked for my details. He also asked for Sh700 to process my appointment letter. I gave in because I needed a job to raise fees for my university education,&quot; said&nbsp;Mwangangi.

He later told me to pick my letter from the post office but when I checked, there was nothing.&quot; Ms Mwangangi said she later called him but he pretended to be on official duty in Machakos and never got back to her.&nbsp; Christine Muange also lost Sh700. &quot;I called him several times but he ignored my calls. That is when I realised I had been conned,&quot; she said. The chief, Gregory Musyoki, yesterday confirmed he linked many youths with the suspect but had warned them against giving him money.
