South Sudan has suspended plans to charge foreign workers a $10,000 work permit fee, the finance minister said, after criticism that it would create a huge expense for aid organisations. War-ravaged South Sudan announced the 100-fold hike in the fee for foreign professionals in early March. Most such workers in the young country are employees of humanitarian groups. &ldquo;The Ministry of Finance acknowledges these significant issues ... and steps are being taken to formulate the best way forward,&quot; Finance Minister Stephen Dhieu Dau told a news conference over the weekend. &quot;The implementing agencies will continue with old rates charged,&quot; he said, adding that parliament was expected to repeal the legislation that approved the fee hike. The previous rate was $100 per foreign worker. The world&#39;s youngest nation has been embroiled in civil war since 2013, when President Salva Kiir fired his deputy Riek Machar, sparking a conflict that has increasingly split the country along ethnic lines.
