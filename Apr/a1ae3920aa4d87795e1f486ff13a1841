Something&nbsp;refreshingly&nbsp;positive&nbsp;is&nbsp;happening&nbsp;in&nbsp;our&nbsp;national&nbsp;discourse. For example, the move by the IEBC to invite the&nbsp;National Super Alliance (NASA) leadership to discuss NASA&rsquo;s proposed move to run a parallel vote tallying centre for the August elections; and the consequent acceptance by the opposition leaders to honour the invite, was wise and conciliatory. It helped nip in the bud a situation that threatened to escalate into high tensions. As has been observed, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with a private tallying of votes, provided that whoever does so recognises that the official results can only be declared by the IEBC. This is a practice that has been seen even in the most mature democracies. In the recent elections in the Netherlands and in the USA, media houses run their tallies while other groups conducted exit polls. But they all emphasised that these were merely indicative and that official results were those announced by the election management bodies. It is gratifying therefore that both NASA and IEBC have taken a similar stand and are willing to work on a process that preserves citizen freedoms while recognising the constitutional mandate and authority of the IEBC. Disturbing trend Similarly&nbsp;refreshing&nbsp;was the decree by the President that doctors should be paid their salaries for the period they were on strike. It was an unfortunate move by the county governments to renege on an agreement that had been arrived at during the return to work negotiations. It has been a disturbing trend where government workers on industrial action have appeared to be duped into returning to work with very&nbsp;positive&nbsp;promises, only for such promises to be dishonoured. This has&nbsp;happened&nbsp;to teachers severally, and was likewise the cause of the recent prolonged doctors&rsquo; strike &ndash; an apparently dishonoured 2013 CBA. This builds a negative culture of mistrust in the foremost employer in the land. It is therefore pleasing to see the government jump that hurdle by the move to honour its promises. These are but two recent examples, from several other&nbsp;positive&nbsp;moves (deliberate and otherwise) by government and opposition leaders, which have had the effect of toning down&nbsp;our&nbsp;national discourse&nbsp;at this critical time of elections. It is a climb down that has shown that with&nbsp;positive&nbsp;resolve,&nbsp;our&nbsp;leaders can actually shuck potentially dangerous rhetoric or actions and embrace servant leadership that focuses on citizens&rsquo; welfare. It demonstrates that no matter how strong&nbsp;our&nbsp;convictions, with proper&nbsp;discourse, we can find solutions that strengthen&nbsp;our&nbsp;democracy and enhance&nbsp;national&nbsp;peace. Being an Easter season, it is perhaps appropriate to learn from what is generally known as the Jesus&rsquo; kenotic mindset. This refers to Jesus&rsquo; emptying of Himself and taking the form of a servant. It is what allowed Him to leave Heaven for earth, wash His disciples&rsquo; feet, and ultimately propelled Him to willingly die at the cross. He thus set an example for us to likewise empty ourselves of&nbsp;our credentials, achievements, wealth,&nbsp;positions, or power, in order to serve the interests of others. This is a critical mindset at election time. ALSO READ: NASA principals in make or break talks Clashes recurred As we all know, Kenya&rsquo;s election campaigns are high octane. The last thing anybody wants to do is to selfishly strike a spark that could set the whole&nbsp;nation&nbsp;on fire, as has&nbsp;happened&nbsp;before. Studies have shown that prior to the 1994 Rwanda genocide, ethnic tensions and clashes recurred every ten years. This being&nbsp;our&nbsp;tenth year since the 2007/8 post-election violence, we need to be extra cautious that we do not stoke fires in dry savannah. We must learn to choose&nbsp;our&nbsp;battles carefully and, in humility, walk away from some. Not every fight is a good fight. - The writer is the Presiding Bishop of Christ is the Answer Ministries (CITAM)
