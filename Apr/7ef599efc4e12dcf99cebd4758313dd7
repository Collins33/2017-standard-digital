The oil-rich Gulf state is home to more than 600,000 domestic helpers, a majority of them Asians, many of whom complain of abuse, mistreatment and non-payment of wages. Hundreds of maids escape their employers every year over abuse, and the government has set up shelters for them. Some seek help from their embassies.
