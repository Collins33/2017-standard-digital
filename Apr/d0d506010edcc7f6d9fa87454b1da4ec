There are many misconceptions about what bouncers are legally allowed to do. Can they use excessive force? Bouncers are not free to engage in excessive force or violence as they see fit. Generally speaking, bouncers can only use force if it is first used against them. These are the same rights as any ordinary citizen (i.e. the right to self-defense). What tasks can they perform? Issue verbal warnings Ask you to leave Check for ID Refuse entry if the customer is too intoxicated, fails to comply with establishment policies, or engages in aggressive behavior Call the police Protect innocent bystanders from violence Break up fights they are not involved in Respond with equal force if necessary What are they trained to do? Most bouncers are trained to remedy situations through verbal communication rather than physical force. Often at times, their presence alone is enough to deter patrons from aggressive behaviour. What are bouncers not allowed to do? Bouncers are not entitled to engage in the use of force unless they are first threatened with physical harm. Thus, unless they are approached with physical threats of harm, bouncers are not permitted to: Strike a patron with a punch or kick Push or physically throw a person out of the establishment Restrain them in a chokeholds or other techniques What do I do if a bouncer assaults me? If you feel that you have an assault claim against a bouncer or the establishment that employed the bouncer, you should take the following steps: Make a written report of the incident while it&rsquo;s still fresh in your mind. Take note of dates, times, and the address where it happened. Be sure to describe the incident itself, the circumstances leading up to the assault, and anything that happened afterwards. Request and keep copies of any police reports that were made Take down important contact information for the bouncer as well as any witnesses to the incident
