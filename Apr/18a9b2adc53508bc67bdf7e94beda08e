Former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru has urged Kirinyaga residents to reject any attempts to have leadership imposed on them. The governor aspirant dismissed those seeking the position though other political parties, claiming that the county was a Jubilee Party zone. She said the county lagged behind in development compared to those in the neighbourhood due to bad leadership. &quot;Our county has nothing to show in terms of physical development and that&#39;s why we want leadership change in order to move fast like other counties,&quot; she said.
