The court has allowed police to detain two men for 15 days to allow further investigations into the hacking of Safaricom&rsquo;s systems. The two, Ugandan Ronald Nsale and Morgan Kamande, a Kenyan, were first arraigned in court three days ago when the prosecution asked for three days to complete its investigations. The detectives said they needed more time to conduct cyber analysis and trace more suspects. Isaac Tenai, attached to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations at Parliament buildings, Nairobi, had asked the court to detain the two.

When the two appeared before the court yesterday, the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) made another application to have them detained for a month as investigations were concluded. State Prosecutor Dancun Ondimu said the respondents were re-arrested on April 5, 2017 outside the Central Police Station and detained at the ATPU headquarters. He said they are being investigated for several terrorism offences, including abetting and supporting terrorism. Ondimu told&nbsp;Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi that ATPU was investigating several phone numbers that have been in communication with the respondents, and whether the hacking was linked to international terrorist groups. He said the suspects might have been illegally hacking into vital installations in the country. The matter will be mentioned on April 21.
