Political&nbsp;wheeler-dealer&nbsp;Stanley&nbsp;Livondo&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;summoned&nbsp;to&nbsp;court&nbsp;in a&nbsp;case&nbsp;in&nbsp;which&nbsp;forensic&nbsp;experts&nbsp;are&nbsp;investigating&nbsp;howhe&nbsp;allegedly&nbsp;forced&nbsp;his&nbsp;way&nbsp;into a&nbsp;suit&nbsp;property&nbsp;in&nbsp;violation&nbsp;of a&nbsp;court&nbsp;order. Justice Grace Nzioka, who is handling the insolvency&nbsp;suit&nbsp;involving Magman Enterprises Limited and Jamii Bora Bank Limited&nbsp;has&nbsp;demanded that&nbsp;investigations&nbsp;be hurried. She directed that&nbsp;Livondo&nbsp;and the parties in the&nbsp;suit&nbsp;be present in&nbsp;court&nbsp;when a report on an&nbsp;alleged&nbsp;forged&nbsp;court&nbsp;order&nbsp;that allowed an administrator appointed by the bank to close down the premise in Mlolongo, is made in&nbsp;court. Livondo&nbsp;was sucked into the&nbsp;case&nbsp;when&nbsp;he&nbsp;stormed the premise,&nbsp;which&nbsp;had&nbsp;been&nbsp;taken over by the administrator, Ponangipalli Rao, on the strength of the questioned&nbsp;order. The judge had earlier issued an&nbsp;order&nbsp;of maintenance of status quo until the insolvency row is resolved. Inspector Martin Muli, who is&nbsp;investigating&nbsp;the&nbsp;case, said&nbsp;he&nbsp;has&nbsp;&quot;recorded five statements so far&quot; and asked for more time to complete&nbsp;his&nbsp;investigations. The&nbsp;case&nbsp;revolves around Magman Enterprises,&nbsp;which&nbsp;is insolvent over a loan from Jamii Bora Bank that had appointed Mr Rao as the administrator. Livondo&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;storing a truck at Magman Enterprises&#39; grounds where the firm runs a shoe making factory. He&nbsp;says the truck was being improved in readiness for the 2017 General Election campaigns. The politician&nbsp;has&nbsp;declared&nbsp;hisinterest in the Kakamega Senate seat. &quot;My reason for being at the factory on February 28, 2017 was due to reports that my truck was being illegally used by staff of the&nbsp;alleged&nbsp;administrators without my permission as a resting place,&quot; says&nbsp;Livondo. A director of Magman, Magdaline Njihia, states in an affidavit that despite the pending&nbsp;case&nbsp;on the insolvency, Rao breached peace and normal operation of her business by procuring a gang of youth who shut her premise in the name of administration. &quot;I am aware that on February 21, 2017, five goons and two security guards appeared at the business premise at Travel House Building in Nairobi in the name of supervising the business activities,&quot; the affidavit reads. Rao is accused of being misled to station security personnel at the premise,&nbsp;which&nbsp;Livondo&nbsp;stormed to get&nbsp;his&nbsp;truck.&nbsp;Livondo&nbsp;has&nbsp;denied&nbsp;he&nbsp;was accompanied by a gang, but only&nbsp;his&nbsp;driver. The&nbsp;case&nbsp;will be mentioned on April 4.
