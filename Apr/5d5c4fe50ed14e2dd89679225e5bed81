Kisumu Central aspirant Onyango Oloo has accused the electoral body of double standards. The aspirant said it was unfair for the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to reject plans by the Opposition to have parallel poll tallying centres in the August 8 General Election. Oloo, the former The National Alliance secretary-general, said IEBC allowed Jubilee to establish a parallel tallying centre in 2013, therefore it should not criticise the National Super Alliance (NASA) for doing the same thing. Oloo claimed he had full details of how Jubilee managed the secret tallying centres. Monday, Oloo told reporters that NASA should ignore IEBC and Jubilee protests over its plan to establish the proposed tallying centre as a way of stopping any attempt to rig the August polls.
