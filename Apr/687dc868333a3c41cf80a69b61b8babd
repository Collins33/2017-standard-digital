&nbsp; Cigarette maker welcomes tax cuts. Low-end cigarette maker Mastermind Tobacco has welcomed the move by the National Treasury to cut taxes on unfiltered cigarettes. The firm&rsquo;s Corporate Affairs Manager Josh Kirimania said lowering taxes on filter-less cigarettes from Sh2.50 per stick to Sh1.80 would afford low-income customers the cigarettes as well as reduce tax revenue losses.
