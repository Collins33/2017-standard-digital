NAIROBI: Embattled&nbsp;National&nbsp;Lands&nbsp;Commission&nbsp;(NLC)&nbsp;Chairman&nbsp;Muhammad&nbsp;Swazuri&nbsp;is an&nbsp;unfit&nbsp;for&nbsp;office,&nbsp;MPs&nbsp;have&nbsp;said. The&nbsp;National&nbsp;Assembly&rsquo;s departmental committee on&nbsp;Lands, which was investigating allegations of misconduct and financial impropriety against him, found him&nbsp;unfit&nbsp;to lead the&nbsp;commission. The committee was to table its report last Thursday but it was shelved due to lack of quorum. Kajiado West MP Moses ole Sakuda and Kapenguria&rsquo;s Samuel Moroto, who are members of the committee,&nbsp;said&nbsp;Swazuri&nbsp;had serious integrity issues. &ldquo;We are done with the probe. The report will be tabled on the floor of the House and a copy sent to the petitioner,&rdquo; Sakuda&nbsp;said. In a petition by former journalist Mugo Njeru,&nbsp;Swazuri&nbsp;is alleged to&nbsp;have&nbsp;paid taxpayers&rsquo; money to individuals for grabbed&nbsp;land. The committee found that some of the&nbsp;land&nbsp;the&nbsp;NLC&nbsp;paid for was actually government&nbsp;land&nbsp;owned by Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC.) NLC&nbsp;commissioners told the&nbsp;commission&nbsp;that&nbsp;Swazuri&nbsp;sanctioned payment of Sh82.3 million for&nbsp;land&nbsp;claimed by Mugo to another party.

They&nbsp;said&nbsp;most of the payments were made in December when they were out of&nbsp;office. Plenary decision They&nbsp;said&nbsp;Swazuri&nbsp;authorised the payments before the committee on grants and dispositions finalised investigations into the ownership of the&nbsp;land&nbsp;in dispute. The commissioners&nbsp;said&nbsp;they were yet to see a letter&nbsp;Swazuri&nbsp;wrote to the KRC, adding that for any ratification to be made, five members of the&nbsp;commission&nbsp;must be present. &ldquo;At any one time a decision is to be made by a subcommittee of the&nbsp;commission, there must be three commissioners. We didn&rsquo;t know about the Sh82 million payment. The decision has to be ratified by the plenary,&rdquo;&nbsp;said&nbsp;Njogu. Musyoka&nbsp;said&nbsp;the&nbsp;land&nbsp;was being claimed by Mugo&rsquo;s wife, Desahe Limited and a Mr Noor. &ldquo;A determination was made that&nbsp;said&nbsp;no payments should be made because the process had not been completed and I table minutes of the meetings held on May 10 and October 22, 2015 to confirm this,&rdquo;&nbsp;said&nbsp;Musyoka. MPs&nbsp;took&nbsp;Swazuri&nbsp;to task for paying individuals claiming public&nbsp;land. &ldquo;Why did the&nbsp;chairman&nbsp;authorise payment without consulting KRC, which is the acquiring entity?&rdquo; asked Rangwe MP George Oner. The committee heard from Cabinet Secretary (CS) Jacob Kaimenyi (Lands),&nbsp;Lands&nbsp;Secretary Kangethe Kahuho and the KRC Chief Executive&nbsp;Officer&nbsp;Athanas Maina.

The CS later confirmed to the committee that the documents used to acquire the&nbsp;land&nbsp;were forged. &ldquo;We can confirm that the individuals forged the documents to acquire the&nbsp;land&nbsp;which was paid out by the&nbsp;commission,&rdquo;&nbsp;said&nbsp;the CS. Maina dismissed claims by&nbsp;Swazuri&nbsp;that the&nbsp;land&nbsp;did not belong to KRC. &ldquo;I&nbsp;have&nbsp;never issued any letter disowning the&nbsp;land&nbsp;in question. As a custodian of KRC properties, I cannot disown what is rightly ours. The corporation did not give the&nbsp;NLC&nbsp;approval to pay for the&nbsp;land&nbsp;in question,&rdquo; Maina told the&nbsp;MPs. MPs&nbsp;asked Njeru to explain how he acquired the two plots valued at Sh82 million and Sh43 million respectively. &ldquo;Mugo, I am sorry to inform you that you are not the owner of piece of&nbsp;land&nbsp;in question. You are a fraudster,&rdquo;&nbsp;said&nbsp;the temporary committee chair George Oner (Rangwe). Kahuho told the committee that the ministry was investigating all documents used to acquire the&nbsp;land&nbsp;and how they made their way to the ministry&rsquo;s official records. Title deeds Director of Physical Planning Augustine Masinde told the committee that his&nbsp;office&nbsp;was not aware of the origin of the Part Development Plan (PDP) used by the allotees to acquire the&nbsp;land. Oner and Sakuda asked why the ministry issued title deeds to the beneficiaries, knowing that the&nbsp;land&nbsp;was fraudulently acquired. They questioned why there were discrepancies in the documents presented by Njeru and the ministry. It is at this point that the&nbsp;Lands&nbsp;Secretary asked to withdraw the documents and promised to table the right documents later. The committee sought to know the relationship between&nbsp;NLC&nbsp;and the ministry. &ldquo;The relations between my&nbsp;office&nbsp;and the&nbsp;commission&nbsp;have&nbsp;not been cozy. It has not been easy to deal with&nbsp;NLC&nbsp;because of the so-called independence. They do things their own way,&rdquo; Kaimenyi&nbsp;said. Swazuri&nbsp;has pleaded his innocence on all claims levelled against him.
