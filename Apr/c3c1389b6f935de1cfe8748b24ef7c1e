Former Konoin MP Julius Kones has conceded defeat to Joyce Laboso in the race for the county Jubilee governorship ticket. Dr Kones said the majority had spoken through ballot and he had no reason to dispute the poll. &quot;I want to confirm that I have conceded defeat to Dr Laboso. I respect the will of the people who have spoken through the ballot and I am wishing my worthy competitor all the best and she should count on me for support moving forward,&quot; Kones declared. &nbsp;He hailed the process saying it was one of the most transparent polls in the recent past.
