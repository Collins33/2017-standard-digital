Police said this after Mombasa Senior Principal Magistrate Francis Kyambia decision to cancel the release of a passport to Awey Ahmed Mohamed who had successfully applied for its release. Awey a British citizen who has been charged along with Zein Mohamed Ahmed, Zahir Abass Khala, Victor Arara Were and Mwangi Muturi who were former employees of the TSS Company are out on bond. The magistrate cancelled the release of the passport after the police alerted the Director of Public Prosecution that Awey who had applied to have his passport swerved with his wife and children&#39;s passport was a suspect. The police alerted the police that the passport should not be released to Awey because the request to swerve his passport with the wife could not work.
