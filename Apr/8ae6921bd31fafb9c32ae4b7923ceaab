Kenyan workers have a reason to smile again after President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to increase minimum wage. State House Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu yesterday also announced the President is waiting for recommendations from the National Police Service Commission and the Salaries and Remuneration Commission on the salaries for members of the security agencies as &ldquo;the welfare of security officers is a paramount concern to President Kenyatta.&rdquo; Last week, Uhuru asked the private sector to increase salaries of workers. The Government, the Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu) and SRC are in discussion regarding an increment in the minimum wage for public sector workers. &ldquo;We have not increased the minimum wage for the past two years and the President favours an increase this year,&rdquo; Esipisu told journalists at the Kisumu State Lodge yesterday. Workers have complained following stagnation of the minimum wage for the past two years given the cost of living has shot up. ALSO READ: Jubilee should do a better job of selling its achievements
