He misses driving, feels as if he is in a cocoon, and is surprised how hard his new job is. President Donald Trump on Thursday reflected on his first 100 days in office with a wistful look at his life before the White House. &quot;I loved my previous life. I had so many things going,&quot; Trump told Reuters in an interview. &quot;This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier.&quot; A wealthy businessman from New York, Trump assumed public office for the first time when he entered the White House on Jan. 20 after he defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in an upset.

When the president leaves the White House, it is usually in a limousine or an SUV. He said he missed being behind the wheel himself. &quot;I like to drive,&quot; he said. &quot;I can&#39;t drive any more.&quot; Many things about Trump have not changed from the wheeler-dealer executive and former celebrity reality show host who ran his empire from the 26th floor of Trump Tower in New York and worked the phones incessantly.
