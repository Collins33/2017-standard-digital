Governor Julius Malombe has accused his rival, Senator David Musila, of lying to people that he influenced his nomination as the party&#39;s governor candidate in 2013. Speaking at Musila&#39;s Migwani home-turf in Mwingi West, Malombe revealed that the Wiper chairman implored the party members to suggest former Kitui South MP Isaac Muoki as the ideal choice, rejecting his candidature with &quot;contempt and mockery&quot;. The governor said he, however, overturned tables by winning the nominations with overwhelming support. &quot;Musila should stop lying to people that he supported my nomination in 2013. He did not.&quot; Musila could not be reached for comment.&nbsp;
