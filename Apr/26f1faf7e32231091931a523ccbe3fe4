Kenya will issue its debut Islamic bond planned for the fiscal year starting in July under existing laws as it pushes legal reforms aimed at boosting Islamic finance, a senior government official said. Henry Rotich, the finance minister, said last month the East African nation planned to amend its laws to enable issuance of the Shariah-compliant bond, part of a plan to mobilise local funds and set up Nairobi as a regional hub for the sector. Githu Muigai, the attorney general, who is the government&#39;s chief legal adviser, told Reuters on Thursday the issuance could go ahead, even if all planned legal reforms are not completed in time. &quot;We will continue with the bond within the institutions that exist right now but we will transition into the new framework sometime next year,&quot; Muigai told Reuters. He said the proposed changes include the consolidation of financial regulations, which are pending before parliament. &quot;This will then give us an opportunity to come back to sector specific problems like deepening and broadening Islamic banking and the various products that are on offer,&quot; he said. Kenya has two Islamic banks, established a decade ago, and several Islamic banking windows, offered by some commercial lenders.
