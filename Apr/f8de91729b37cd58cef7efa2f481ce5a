Meru Governor Peter Munya Wednesday urged the High Court to throw out a petition seeking to block him from defending his seat. Munya, who is represented by city lawyer Okong&#39;o Omogeni, told Justice Alfred Mabeya sitting in Meru that the petition by businessman Isaiah Kithinji lacked seriousness and was brought to court purely to annoy the respondent. &quot;This is a classical case of a petitioner who seeks to abuse the court process, attract publicity and play politics in a courtroom,&quot; Omogeni said. Omogeni urged the court not to entertain the issue, saying this was not the right forum to make the declarations sought. &quot;The Constitution has created institutions where allegations of corruption against any State officer can be made,&quot; he said. Kithinji wants Munya barred from presenting his papers to IEBC, arguing that his government has on many occasions been censured by the Auditor General.
