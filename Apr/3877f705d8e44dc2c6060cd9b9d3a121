Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has criticised the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) for giving direct party tickets to some aspirants. The governor wants to know the criteria that party leader Raila Odinga used to reward 400 aspirants direct nominations. Mr Ojaamong has warned that ODM risks a massive fallout in the county over the tickets. He said some beneficiaries of the free tickets did not deserve them. Senator Amos Wako and CountyLeader of Majority Josephat Wandera from Busia were among the 400 aspirants that Raila gave a free ride. He said some members have been with the party during high and low tides but were ignored, yet politicians who have not been active in party politics got tickets. &quot;The party has not made public the criteria it used to award inactive people free tickets, leaving out party loyalists,&quot; said Mr Ojaamong.
