Several people were injured Saturday when they were pelted with stones as two political rival groups clashed in Eldoret town. Vehicles belonging to Uasin Gishu governor aspirant Zedekiah Kiprop, alias Buzeki, were extensively damaged and police were forced to lob teargas canisters and shoot in the air to disperse the rowdy crowds. Trouble started when Buzeki&rsquo;s convoy snaked its way into the town&rsquo;s Central Business District (CBD) but supporters waving Governor Jackson Mandago&rsquo;s posters started pelting the vehicles with stones. Buzeki had earlier made stopovers in several estates in the town without any ugly incident. The duo were engaged in a bruising battle for the gubernatorial seat in the just concluded Jubilee Party primaries, but Mandago trounced Buzeki. Buzeki however contested the results, saying the nomination was marred by numerous malpractices.
