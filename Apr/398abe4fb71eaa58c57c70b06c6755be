Voters in Sigor Constituency, West Pokot County, were on Friday forced to use the mlolongo system in the Jubilee nominations due to insufficient ballot papers. All aspirants who agreed to use the queue system were required to sign agreement documents with presiding officers to ensure they did not disown the method later during tallying. &quot;We opted for mlolongo and voters agreed because ballot materials had not arrived at a single polling station,&quot; said Musa Tekelezi, an aspiring MCA. There were protests at Makutano Stadium polling station where ballot papers for MCAs were missing. The exercise was disrupted for one hour as police tried to stop the angry voters from vandalising the ballot boxes. Speaking after casting his vote at Siyoi Primary school, Governor Simon Kachapin accused the Jubilee Party national secretariat for being ill-prepared for the primaries. In Trans-Nzoia County, the nominations were cancelled as aspirants demanded&nbsp; the sacking of party secretary general Raphael Tuju, accusing him of sabotage. Ballot papers were set on fire at one of the polling centres.
