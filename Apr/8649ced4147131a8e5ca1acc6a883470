NAIROBI: The High Court has blocked Nairobi County from demanding parking fees from the customers of PrideInn Hotel in Parklands. High Court judge George Odunga gave the orders after the hotel lamented that county askaris have been harassing its customers and clamping their cars demanding parking fees. &nbsp;The judge said the county had no powers to levy fees around the hotel and that it had exceeded the powers given by the law. &quot;I find that the respondents have no power to levy fees on the suit property. Accordingly, they have no justification in clamping the applicant&#39;s vehicles. By purporting to do so the respondents exceeded their jurisdiction and abused their powers, hence their decision must be quashed,&quot; said Justice Odunga. The case was sparked by an incident in November 2016 when the askaris demanded that be paid parking fees or have the vehicles in the hotel&#39;s parking lot clamped. Justice Odunga heard that the county officers asked for free holidays and other favours from PrideInn hotels.
