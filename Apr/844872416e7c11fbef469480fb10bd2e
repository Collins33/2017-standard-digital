Business tycoon Chris Kirubi has told off Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko over an offer to join his team of advisors. Kirubi said he has never spoken or met Sonko to discuss possibilities of working with him. &quot;How do you offer a job to someone you have never met or spoken to? I don&#39;t know this man neither do I have his number,&quot; Kirubi quipped. On Saturday morning, Sonko posted on his Facebook page telling his critics that he is not a PhD. holder but that will not stop him from serving Kenyans. Once elected, the Senator said he will bring on board technocrats with whom he is going to work with in policy making, implementation and pushing for Nairobi County&rsquo;s development and economic agenda. &quot;I am and have always been a team player who will delegate, assign, and appoint professionals to run the affairs of the county, to that effect, plans are underway to make investor Chris Kirubi as our county&#39;s Chief Economic Advisor,&quot; Sonko&#39;s post read.

However Sunday afternoon, Kirubi said he is not interested in the job and asked Sonko to keep it. &quot;I am not interested in politics, I work for International organisations and I have no time for Sonko&rsquo;s job offer,&quot; the businessman who is associated with the new Two Rivers Mall, Capital FM, International Life House, Nairobi Bottlers Ltd, Haco industries among others said. Sonko is fighting out for the Jubilee Party ticket against former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth and Bishop Margaret Wanjiru.
