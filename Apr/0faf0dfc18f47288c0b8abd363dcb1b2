Deputy President William Ruto has taken over preparations for repeat primaries of the Jubilee headquarters which have been scheduled for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week. Sources told the Standard that Ruto is &quot;over-sighting the preparations&quot; to ensure all loose ends are tied in time. The party must print millions of ballot papers that were missing when party members thronged polling stations on Friday in vain. It must also put all the necessary logistics for the primaries- vehicles, personnel, machines and stationery by end of tomorrow. &ldquo;Yes he is here and he&rsquo;s not leaving anything to chance,&rdquo; a source at the secretariat said. Earlier in the morning, party leader and President Uhuru Kenyatta told party supporters that an additional backup would be send to the headquarters to assist secretariat in planning for new primaries. He said although he had confidence in the team led by Secretary General Raphael Tuju, it was necessary to add more personnel to the team.
