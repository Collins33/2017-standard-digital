Nominated MP Isaac Mwaura has claimed that there is a plot to assassinate him after he was attacked by an opponent and his supporters. The lawmaker, who is contesting the Ruiru parliamentary seat, was injured on Tuesday in Githurai Kimbo, allegedly by supporters of Simon Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a Kinga&rsquo;ra. The MP said he had gone to enquire why Mr King&rsquo;ara, in the company of his supporters, was demolishing boda boda sheds he had built in the area. &ldquo;When I asked why they were destroying the sheds, which I had built for the operators, they attacked me with all manner of weapons including guns. In the process I was injured on my left ear by a bullet and it was only by the grace of God that I am alive today,&rdquo; Mr Mwaura said. However in a swift rejoinder, King&rsquo;ara denied that his supporters attacked the MP, saying that it was Mwaura who instigated violence after he came where he and his supporters were repairing a bridge. Ruiru OCPD Isaac Thuranira confirmed there was a confrontation between Mwaura and King&rsquo;ara but said &ldquo;there were no gunshots&rdquo;.&nbsp;
