Kakamega&nbsp;County&nbsp;is&nbsp;racing&nbsp;against&nbsp;time&nbsp;to&nbsp;control&nbsp;the&nbsp;spread&nbsp;of the&nbsp;dreaded&nbsp;fall&nbsp;army&nbsp;worms&nbsp;that&nbsp;continue&nbsp;to&nbsp;destroy&nbsp;farms&nbsp;in&nbsp;Western&nbsp;Kenya. The pests, which invaded&nbsp;farms&nbsp;in&nbsp;Kakamega&nbsp;County&nbsp;last week, have already&nbsp;spread&nbsp;to Bungoma&nbsp;County. Experts had earlier warned that the pest could&nbsp;spread&nbsp;across the entire region if quick action is not taken. Kakamega&nbsp;County&nbsp;has since set aside Sh3 million for purchase of chemicals to help&nbsp;control&nbsp;the the pest&rsquo;s&nbsp;spread. The&nbsp;county&rsquo;s&nbsp;agriculture boss Kulati Wangia yesterday emerged from a meeting with Governor Wycliffe Oparanya to announce that money had been released as a matter of urgency. &ldquo;We are staring at a disaster because the pest is fast&nbsp;spreading&nbsp;to Trans Nzoia, which is the country&rsquo;s food basket. So far, there are deliberations among the four&nbsp;counties&nbsp;in former&nbsp;WesternProvince namely Vihiga, Bungoma, Busia,&nbsp;Kakamega&nbsp;and Trans Nzoia on how we can pool resources to rid ourselves of the armyworm menace,&rdquo; he said yesterday.

From Ghana &ldquo;The&nbsp;worm&nbsp;found its way into our territory from Ghana and South Africa due to climate change. The pest is deadly and new, its effects may take longer than expected because they feast on both young and mature crop,&rdquo; said Kulati, who added that they were planning to involve the national government because the interventions required might be costly. &ldquo;We encourage farmers to&nbsp;continue&nbsp;spraying their&nbsp;farms&nbsp;as we try to look for more resources,&rdquo; he said. Jacob Masimba, a&nbsp;county&nbsp;agricultural officer in&nbsp;Kakamega, revealed that at least 60 per cent of&nbsp;farms&nbsp;had been attacked by the deadly pest. &ldquo;We have started organising public barazas to enable us create awareness and give farmers tips on how to stop the pest from&nbsp;spreading&nbsp;further and causing more harm,&rdquo; he said. He said they were working closely with chiefs, ward administrators and extension officers to successfully deal with the insects.

Experts said the&nbsp;fall&nbsp;army&nbsp;worms&nbsp;were similar to the African&nbsp;army&nbsp;worms, but the former are more lethal when they invade crops. Masimba said the pest could resort to attacking sorghum, rice, Napier grass and even ordinary grass after wiping out all maize&nbsp;farms. &ldquo;That is why we are calling upon farmers to attend our public barazas to learn more and know the exact chemicals to use.&rdquo; Farmers have been advised to pool resources and buy the required chemicals as opposed to resorting to traditional methods such as smearing cow dung on affected crops.

Experts will recommend effective chemicals.&rdquo; Some farmers earlier said they had been boiling water and pouring it on the affected crops but the method had not worked out. Offices belonging to chiefs, ward administrators and even local MCAs have been converted into information centres where farmers have been reporting the presence of&nbsp;army&nbsp;worms. Masimba said there are affordable chemicals farmers can rely on to effectively&nbsp;control&nbsp;the pest.
