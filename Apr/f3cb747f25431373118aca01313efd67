Holy Family Minor Basilica&#39;s Fr Simon Ng&#39;ang&#39;a urged the faithful to embrace true Christianity by accepting everyone. &quot;Your Christianity has no meaning if you don&#39;t treat everyone as your brothers and sisters. We are all Kenyans,&quot; said Ng&#39;ang&#39;a as the church celebrated Palm Sunday. Consistent prayers He also urged Christians to strengthen their faith through consistent prayer.
