The electoral agency has&nbsp;threatened to impose sanctions against those found guilty of propagating violence in the ongoing party primaries. In light of this, Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission Chairman Wafula Chebukati called for tolerance even as he condemned the chaotic scenes. He also sought to remind political parties and aspirants that they were bound by the Electoral Code of Conduct and &quot;we will impose sanctions against candidates and political parties who contravene the code&quot;. &quot;The commission is keenly watching and any perpetrators will be dealt with according to the law,&quot; Mr Chebukati&nbsp;warned. He went on: &quot;We have worked out mechanisms for preventing and punishing criminal activities during elections.&quot; &nbsp; ALSO READ: Opinion: NASA stands for confusion
