Police in Kwale County on Friday impounded 41.9 kilogrammes of elephant tusks worth about Sh2 million. Also arrested in connection with the ivory haul was a woman said to be dealing with tusks. The trophies were netted at a homestead in Ganja village, Msambweni Sub-county. Last year police also arrested four people who are still facing charges at a Mombasa court for being in possession of ivory. Msambweni OCPD Joseph Chebusit said police got a tip off from the public who informed them that there were elephant&#39;s tusks in the woman&#39;s house. The tusks were cut into pieces and stuffed in sacks perhaps for easier transportation. &quot;We conducted an operation and on reaching the suspect&#39;s house we found two sacks stuffed with the trophies,&quot; he said.
