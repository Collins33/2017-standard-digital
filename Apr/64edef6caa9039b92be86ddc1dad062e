President&nbsp;Uhuru&nbsp;Kenyatta&nbsp;will&nbsp;lead&nbsp;Kenyans&nbsp;in&nbsp;celebrating&nbsp;this&nbsp;year&rsquo;s&nbsp;Madaraka&nbsp;Day&nbsp;at&nbsp;Kabiruini&nbsp;ground. The National&nbsp;Celebrations&nbsp;Organising Committee settled on the&nbsp;grounds&nbsp;outside Nyeri town Tuesday and is now planning to give it a facelift ahead of the&nbsp;celebrations&nbsp;on June 1. Committee chairman Bare Mohammed led an inspection tour of&nbsp;Kabiruini&nbsp;Tuesday. &ldquo;The team toured Ruringu Stadium but left after a few minutes for&nbsp;Kabiruini&nbsp;grounds, where we inspected the vast field and facilities,&rdquo; said Mr Mohammed. &ldquo;After careful consultations between the committee and representatives of the county government, we have made a decision that this&nbsp;year&rsquo;s&nbsp;Madaraka&nbsp;Day&nbsp;celebrations&nbsp;will be held at&nbsp;Kabiruini.&rdquo; He said the&nbsp;grounds&nbsp;would be renovated to meet the required standards. &ldquo;We came to Nyeri with various options but we have settled on this area because it has adequate space and will require only a facelift to meet the team&rsquo;s specifications.&rdquo; ALSO READ: Nyeri Mortuary gets green light to bury unclaimed bodies He said they rejected Ruringu, which has historical significance, because it did not meet the required security standards. &ldquo;Ruringu Stadium is not suitable for the event. According to the military representatives on the committee, there are tall buildings located nearby and this is not acceptable,&rdquo; said Mohammed. Central Regional Co-ordinator Naftaly Mung&rsquo;athia assured&nbsp;Kenyans&nbsp;that the national government would make adequate security arrangements for the venue on&nbsp;Madaraka&nbsp;Day. &ldquo;It is a great honour for Nyeri County, which is the headquarters for Central Kenya, to be selected to host the national&nbsp;celebrations,&rdquo; he said. County Secretary Alice Wachira said the event would benefit the county economically by boosting domestic tourism while highlighting Nyeri&rsquo;s contribution to the freedom struggle. &ldquo;Nyeri is home to the Mau Mau struggle that led to independence. This is an opportunity to remember those who sacrificed for independence,&rdquo; she said.
