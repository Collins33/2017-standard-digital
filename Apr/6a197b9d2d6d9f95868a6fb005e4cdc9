NASA leaders Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula have&nbsp;warned Coast residents to be wary of Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s frequent visits to the region. They alleged that Ruto&rsquo;s close ties with Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya were suspicious and claimed that top Jubilee leaders were plotting to seize land in the areas where minerals have been discovered. Addressed supporters in Kinango, the two leaders accused the Jubilee administration of using force to intimidate Coast residents. They said President Uhuru Kenyatta has become frustrated on realising that the Opposition was not breaking up. &ldquo;Any of the four NASA principals can be president. We are a team determined to liberate Kenya from Jubilee&rsquo;s misrule,&rdquo; Mr Kalonzo said as Mr Wetang&rsquo;ula added: &ldquo;Liberty will come on August 8 when one of us becomes president, which will be victory for all of us and the whole country&rdquo;. The two demanded an investigation into Ruto&rsquo;s &ldquo;vast&rdquo; wealth and accused Mr Mvurya of &ldquo;begging&rdquo; for handouts from President Uhuru Kenyatta instead of protecting Kwale&rsquo;s mineral wealth and using devolved funds to build roads and combat poverty.

The former vice-president described Mvurya as a traitor to his voters for leaving the Opposition to join Jubilee. Kalonzo suggested that Mvurya left the Opposition to seek protection for alleged mismanagement of the county government.
