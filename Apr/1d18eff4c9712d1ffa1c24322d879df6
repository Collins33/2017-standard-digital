We should expect another heated week as political parties continue with the exercise of picking candidates during their nominations across the country. The apprehension among the general populace is understandable given the country&rsquo;s violent past during elections. Not surprisingly, every election is viewed against the prism of the 2007 poll, where the massive scale of brutal killings brought the country to the brink. This is why there must be more vocal and urgent messages calling for peaceful elections by all and sundry. Except for the clergy, the business community and political party heads, calls for tolerance from rank and file politicians have been rather muted. We expect candidates in Jubilee Party to echo calls by President Uhuru Kenyatta for more restraint and mature campaigns at this time. Commendably, the Orange Democratic Movement acted swiftly and fined Migori Governor Okoth Obado Sh2 million and Nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro Sh1 million following violent act by their supporters.&nbsp; These politicians must not escape sanctions, and if they defect to other political parties to avoid paying these hefty fines, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission must hold them accountable. Regrettably, there seems to be double standards when dealing with politicians, who unlike most, get off scot-free when they or their supporters breach the peace. &nbsp;Women have frequently been victims of misogynistic attacks, with little action taken against the perpetrators even as their political parties and the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) pay lip service in their calls for fair treatment. More must be done to convince Kenyans that we will have peaceful campaigns before the August 8 poll. Violence must never be used to subvert the democratic process.
