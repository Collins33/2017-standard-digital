MOLO, KENYA: Traders and residents of Molo town are living in fear following the rising cases of insecurity in the town and its environs. A series of robbery with violence targeting supermarkets have been reported in the past one month with the thugs getting away with cash and other goods stolen at gunpoint. The most recent incident took place on Wednesday night where thugs armed with two AK47 rifles raided five supermarkets consecutively in the silent town and stole an unknown amount of money. Molo Business Community Chairman Charles Marioko said for the past 2 months, the town has been affected by a wave of crimes where dozens of night clubs and M-PESA outlets have been broken into. &quot;Business people are in fear since the thugs are attacking our premises as early as 7pm. This has greatly affected the businesses as we have to close down immediately after sunset,&quot; said Marioko. The business community called on police to beef up security in the area adding that if the trend continues they will close their businesses for a week and take to the streets. Marioko urged businessmen in the town to ensure they install surveillance cameras at their premises to ensure the robbers are identified and provide evidence admissible in the courts when an arrest is made. &quot;Molo Deputy County Commissioner Hassan Bule confirmed the outcry saying the authorities are laying traps for the thugs. He called on the locals to volunteer any leads that will assist in their arrest.&rdquo; &quot;Security has deteriorated in the past few months but the police are alert. Our officers are doing their best to curb this menace,&quot; the DC said.
