The 58th edition of the National Schools and College Drama Festival started on a thrilling note. The icing on the cake was the sterling performance of Moi Primary School Kabarak. Moi Primary&rsquo;s play titled &lsquo;The Silent Bridge&rsquo;, moved the audience at the packed Kisumu Girls&rsquo; High School hall. It told the story of a girl neglected by her parents after they separated. The riveting play ends on a sober note as the couple reconcile and reunite, after they see how their fights were affecting their children. The play brilliantly tackles the issue of domestic violence. &ldquo;Domestic issues have become order of the day and it is clear that it is the children who are affected most. So the play tends to find solution to this societal problem,&rdquo; said Felix Ochieng&rsquo;, the playwright. Kabarak will be battling for the trophy with 15 other schools in the same category on April 16. Flamingo Secondary School from Nakuru was a splendour on stage with their cultural creative dance on reconciliation and peace building. The just-ended doctors&rsquo; strike was renacted by St Mary&rsquo;s Igoji Girls in their piece titled &lsquo;Epitaph&rsquo;s&rsquo;.
