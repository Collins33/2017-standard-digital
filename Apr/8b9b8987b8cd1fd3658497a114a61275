MURANG&#39;A: Two people implicated in the murder of televangelist Bishop Pius Muiru&#39;s mother will be charged next week. Murang&#39;a High Court judge Hatari Waweru Thursday remanded Monicah Muthoni and security guard Ezekiel Saitabu Nakola until April 20, when they will take a plea. Muthoni is a daughter-in-law of Grace Wangari Mwangi who was brutally murdered a fortnight ago, and her body buried in a shallow grave. The suspects were remanded at Murang&#39;a GK Prison.
