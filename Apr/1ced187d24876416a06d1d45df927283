Aspirants converge at Busara Primary School in Umoja to chat the way forward as voters are locked outside for lack of clerks and presiding officers in the entire Embakasi Constituency. (Photo: George Orido, Standard) ODM primaries in Embakasi West Constituency were yet to kick off by Sunday noon for lack of clerks and presiding officers and there was growing impatience among voters who arrived at polling stations as early as 5am. Voters in some of the stations locked outside as there was no activity taking place. At Busara Primary School in Umoja, MP Aspirants James Nga&#39;ng&#39;u, Boaz Ogello, Tom Agimba gathered to consult on the best way forward as there were only two returning officers for the entire constituency. &quot;We are trying to do everything possible to make sure our voters cast their ballots. That&#39;s why we are consulting&quot; says parliamentary aspirant Tom Agimba. According to ODM party official Jane Ramogi, help was not forthcoming from Orange House.
