Deputy President William Ruto is upbeat that Jubilee will retain power because most of what it promised Kenyans has already been fulfilled. Ruto on Friday took Jubilee campaigns to Amukura in Busia County where he rallied locals to support the Jubilee Government. He appealed to the residents to listen to both Jubilee and the National Super Alliance (NASA) and decide which camp had a favourable agenda for Kenyans. The DP said Jubilee had done tremendous work since it took over power in 2013 and remained optimistic that Kenyans will support the re-election bid of President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August elections. Follow Blindly Ruto cautioned residents not to follow blindly the Opposition, saying they had nothing substantive to offer. “Kenyans have seen what we have done for the four years we have been in power. We intend to do a lot for people we were elected to serve,” said DP Ruto. He scoffed at NASA principals Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula inability to agree on a candidate. “They formed a technical committee to come up with methodology of picking flagbearer but even that committee has found it hard. They do not have a presidential candidate but we in Jubilee know our presidential candidate,” he said. He lashed out at the Opposition for criticising government projects and said Jubilee has managed to revamp several factories that were on verge of collapse. “I was shocked when I heard an Opposition leader saying that we are connecting power to grass thatched houses; we are going to continue with the programme until our people have electricity in their homes,” he said. Ruto laid a foundation stone for the Okame Technical Training Institute and asserted that the government will disburse resources to facilitate its construction.
