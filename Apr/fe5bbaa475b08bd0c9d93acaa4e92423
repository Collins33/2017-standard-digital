(PICTURE BY DENNIS KAVISU) Wiper Democratic Movement leader Kalonzo Musyoka has assured his supporters of his win come the General Election. Speaking on Saturday in Ukunda, Kwale County in a two-day tour to drum up support for the National Super Alliance (NASA), Kalonzo said a NASA government will address human rights violations and demands by local pressure groups through legitimate and constitutional means instead of resorting to brute force to stifle dissent and evade solving past injustices. Kalonzo said going by the number of registered voters it was just a matter of time before NASA is sworn in. &quot;There is no way Jubilee is going to win. They have already gone home and they know it,&quot; he said. The former vice president noted that this time round he is wiser. &quot;If you want to succeed you have to play stupid. I will not throw stones but I will use words just to win the elections,&quot; he said. The presidential aspirant accused Jubilee of marginalising Coast region and perpetuating a policy of extra-judicial killing of Muslim youth. He argued that the older system where presidential results from polling stations were validated in Nairobi was a recipe for rigging. &quot;When we talked of parallel voter tallying they (Jubilee) said we want to bring chaos into the country... but chaos can be brought if they try to rig,&quot; he said.

Come August 8 they should go home,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
