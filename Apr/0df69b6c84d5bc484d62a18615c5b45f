Political differences between Deputy President William Ruto and Emurua Dikirr MP Johanna Ng&rsquo;eno played out over the weekend during President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s tour of the county. Mr Ng&rsquo;eno accused the DP of sidelining some Kalenjin leaders. There was some drama as a section of the crowd believed to be supporters of the MP forced Governor Samuel Tunai and National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale to shorten their speeches. Mr Ng&rsquo;eno recently ditched the Kenya National Congress (KNC) party for Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM), where he is supporting the party&rsquo;s gubernatorial aspirant Patrick Ntutu, who is the also the Narok West MP. When Mr Ruto rose to speak, a section of the crowd attempted to shout him down but he remained composed, tactfully switched to the Kalenjin dialect and managed to calm the crowd before proceeding with his speech.

Can you raise your hands and show Kenya that Emurua Dikirr and Trans Mara are in Jubilee,&rdquo; Ruto told the crowd amid cheers. The DP said he would pitch camp in the constituency to ensure the area remains in Jubilee. &ldquo;I am going to come back. I have seen we have a lot to do here. We shall come and face off squarely,&rdquo; Ruto told the residents. Ng&rsquo;eno, who received a rousing welcome from the crowd, defended himself against claims that he held a grudge against the DP. &ldquo;We have no problem with you; your excellency the President. We fully support you,&rdquo; he said.
