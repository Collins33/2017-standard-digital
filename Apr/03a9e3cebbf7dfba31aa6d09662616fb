Proposals developed by the State could see expansion of the proposed mass transport system services in the city to cover additional outlying areas outside the central business district. Under the proposals, the current commuter line covering 170 kilometres will be expanded to the environs to include Ngong, Kiambu town, and Lukenya. The State has also reviewed the network coverage for the proposed bus rapid transit system (BRTS) to cover additional areas to be served by five lines - Ndovu, Simba, Chui, Kifaru, and Nyati. &quot;Through various studies carried out under the Ministry of Transport, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development, a mass rapid transit system network was recommended involving BRTS and commuter rail services,&quot; state the proposals tabled before the Senate Transport Committee by Transport Principal Secretary Mwangi Mariga. The Ndovu BRT line will be expanded to cover Limuru-Kangemi-CBD-Imara Daima, JKIA-Athi River, and terminate at Kitengela. Simba line will cover Rongai-Bomas-CBD and Ruiru.
