Plans to install new improved digital custom systems at the Busia and Malaba borders to curb smuggling are underway. Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) Deputy Commissioner Kevin Safari said the initiative seeks to create level playground for traders. Speaking in Busia on Friday, he observed that the commission is fully alive to the fact that some unscrupulous traders are using unorthodox means to ferry in goods from the neighbouring country to avoid paying tax. &nbsp;&quot;We want to seal all loopholes along the borders that unscrupulous traders are using to smuggle goods into the country. We want people to pay tax and do clean business,&quot; he added. ALSO READ: Busia doctors and nurses vow to stay away from dirty wards
