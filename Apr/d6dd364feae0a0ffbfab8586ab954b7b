Panic has gripped Jubilee aspirants in North Rift following claims that powerful individuals in Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s office have drawn up a list of preferred candidates for the party primaries. The individuals, some of who are the DP&rsquo;s personal aides, are alleged to be plotting to have one of their own control the administration of their targeted areas by influencing the nominations results. Areas claimed to be on the operatives&#39; watchlist include Uasin Gishu governorship, Kapseret, Nandi Hills and Cherangany parliamentary seats in the North Rift. But the alleged &lsquo;targeted&rsquo; leaders in the region have demanded that the Friday party nominations must be free and fair. The aspirants have asked the DP to rein in his handlers out to influence results of the nominations. Speaking at Ziwa during a charged political meeting, Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi and Governor Jackson Mandago sensationally claimed the operatives want to grab land and pilfer public resources in the region thus the rush to &lsquo;plant friendly&rsquo; candidates on the people.

We shall not accept rigging and we shall fight off to the end for justice to prevail,&rdquo; said Sudi. Sudi is facing challenge from Stephen Yego while his vocal Nandi Hills counterpart Alfred Keter is battling it out with former Communications Director in the DPs office Emmanuel Tallam. Mandago is also facing stiff competition from business magnate Zedekiah Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, in the upcoming Jubilee primaries. Buzeki is perceived to be working with the DP&#39;s office but the aspirant has shrugged off the claims.
