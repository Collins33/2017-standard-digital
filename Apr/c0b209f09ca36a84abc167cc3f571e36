REA said it was accelerating the pace of rural electrification in the country to enable the Government to beat the deadline. REA Chairman Simon Gicharu said the authority was committed to realising the Government&rsquo;s vision of increasing access to electricity for rural communities in a bid to promote sustainable socio-economic growth.
