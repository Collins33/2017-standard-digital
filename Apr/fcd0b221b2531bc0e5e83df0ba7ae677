The chaos we are seeing now is a show of love for the political parties that we have. We in Jubilee are witnessing an unprecedented scenario that we didn&rsquo;t anticipate. &nbsp;Because we are in Government and the Jubilee Party has been joined by a number of other parties, it has become popular and everyone wants to get its ticket. The chaos witnessed in nominations is about getting a ticket from the most popular party and doesn&rsquo;t mean that people will fight come the August elections. The difference right now is that parties had underestimated the magnitude of carrying out nominations and hadn&rsquo;t prepared fully for the exercise. There is also the case of not enough security personnel being provided. But in August, during the General Election, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) will conduct the elections. Government will also provide adequate security. The electoral agency has been preparing for this for a long time and we don&rsquo;t expect that people will resort to chaos during the real elections. The chaos we are witnessing now should be a lesson to us that in future parties should be enabled financially to conduct free and fair nominations and also provide enough security.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Jubilee Party has failed in fairness- Aspirant Kobia Maranya
