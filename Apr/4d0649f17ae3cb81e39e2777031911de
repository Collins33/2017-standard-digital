Lawyer Phillip Murgor, who unveiled his decision to run for the presidential elections under the United Democratic Movement (UDM) party late last year, has quit the race, citing Kenya&#39;s tribal voting patterns. He said his pronouncement came &quot;after long reflection on the terrible state of the circus that characterises the country&#39;s politics&quot;, which he said is driven by the scourges of corruption and tribalism. &quot;Over time, leadership and by extension the presidency, has become a matter of who can galvanise the tribal numbers or groupings using vast amounts of unexplained, many times illegally obtained finance,&quot; he said. Mr Murgor added that conducting campaigns for several months is unsustainable for any candidate of modest and accountable means.&nbsp;
