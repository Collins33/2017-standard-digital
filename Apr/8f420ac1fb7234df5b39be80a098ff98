The Government has unveiled 462 housing units in Syokimau as part of a long-term plan to eradicate expansion of informal settlements in urban areas while at the same time providing affordable shelter for low-income earners. Principal Secretary in the State department of Housing and Urban Development, Arch Aidha Munano, said the sh1.1 billion project includes social facilities such as chapels, shopping centres, a school, multipurpose hall, police station as well as playground. Munano, who inspected the site at the weekend, said the project comprised both high-end and low-cost units ranging between one-bedroom to four-bedroom houses. This is one of the flagship projects expected to service the upcoming Sh800 billion Konza Techno City.&nbsp; &quot;This sustainable neighbourhood programme is aimed at setting standards on how low-end settlement can be developed through an integrated system that sets out provision for essential social amenities for modern living,&quot; she said. She said it is also expected to address traffic congestion arising from the need to travel outside of the facility. &quot;That is why it includes schools and shopping centres to stop regular travel to and fro,&quot; she noted.
