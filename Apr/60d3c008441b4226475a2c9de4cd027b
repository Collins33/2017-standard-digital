From the outset, President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy, William Ruto declared the only politicians in the Executive arm of government would be themselves. Public officers were expected to remain apolitical because the offices they hold transcend the political divide. Indeed, the drafters of the 2010 Constitution saw it fit that the appointment of a Cabinet Secretary follows a competitive vetting and hiring process and that if a politician, the candidate relinquishes their seats. Because of political expediency, a lot of previous ministers ended up being ineffective. The new Constitution offered a fresh breath of air. The rationale was simple; that technocrats were less likely to spend more time indulging in unproductive, partisan politics. So the green light given to Cabinet Secretaries by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to openly engage in active political campaigns on the basis of Chapter 23 of Leadership and Integrity Act goes counter to the spirit of the Constitution. That exemption exposes Cabinet Secretaries to situations that might bring disrepute to their offices. A situation where a Cabinet Secretary engages in a spat with opponents that could bring ridicule to the office he or she holds, is in direct contravention of Chapter Six of the Constitution. It is not for nothing that politics is referred to as a dirty game.
