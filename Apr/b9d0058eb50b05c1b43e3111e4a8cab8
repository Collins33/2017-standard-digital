A group of former councilors from Meru and Nyambene are demanding&nbsp;Sh1.5 million compensation for &quot;their toil and dedicated service&quot; to the people. The over 200 civic leaders who served in the defunct county councils claim they were entitled to a &#39;reasonable&#39; gratuity after working hard to lay the foundation for devolution. In a petition to the Meru County Assembly, the former councilors said they were living in poverty, and asked for a one-off payment of Sh1.5 million. Led by Chairman Stephen Kaberia and Coordinator Robert Ntonjira, the councilors have also asked for a monthly stipend of Sh30, 000 to cushion themselves against the harsh economic times that befell them after the 2013 General Election which ushered in devolution. Mr Kaberia said they were a disillusioned lot because the national government had abandoned them, yet they should be credited for building hospitals, schools, factories and other infrastructural projects. &quot;County governments could not have taken off successfully had it not been for the assets they inherited from councils. They are just continuing what we started. It is a pity that while MPs had gratuity we who initiated everything do not have a pension,&quot; said Kaberia.
