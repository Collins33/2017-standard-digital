Agricultural ministers have agreed on a plan to fight the red palm weevil, which ravages coconut, date and oil palms, experts have said, describing it as &quot;a global threat&quot;. &nbsp;The strategy includes greater involvement of farmers in combating the weevil, improved pest monitoring and a proposed ban on the import of palms larger than 6cm wide from infested countries. In some countries, farmers have set up smart phone messaging app groups to share information and alerts, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said. &quot;The red palm weevil has become a global threat and demands a global strategy to eradicate it,&quot; FAO head Jose da Silva said.&nbsp;
