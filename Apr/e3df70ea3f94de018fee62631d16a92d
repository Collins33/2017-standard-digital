President&nbsp;Uhuru&nbsp;Kenyatta&rsquo;s&nbsp;Cabinet&nbsp;has&nbsp;hit&nbsp;the&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;trail&nbsp;to&nbsp;marshal&nbsp;support&nbsp;for&nbsp;his&nbsp;re-election&nbsp;ahead&nbsp;of the&nbsp;August&nbsp;8 General&nbsp;Election. Although the law prohibits&nbsp;Cabinet&nbsp;Secretaries from engaging in politics, the top public servants have thrown caution to the wind and embarked on an aggressive drive to woo&nbsp;support&nbsp;for&nbsp;President&nbsp;Kenyatta and&nbsp;his&nbsp;Jubilee government. Both the Constitution and&nbsp;Elections&nbsp;Act bars State officers from engaging in active politics, which is not limited only to vying for&nbsp;elective&nbsp;posts but also participating in political party activities such as&nbsp;campaigns. The Public Officers&rsquo; Ethics Act and leadership and integrity laws require that a public officer should not engage in political activities that may compromise or be seen to interfere with the neutrality of their office. In spite of all these laws, several CSs appear to have been deployed to various parts of the country not only to &ldquo;launch and coordinate&rdquo; development projects but also convince voters why they should&nbsp;re-elect&nbsp;President&nbsp;Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.&nbsp;Cabinet&nbsp;Secretaries and Principal Secretaries (PSs) were first deployed to&nbsp;campaigns&nbsp;during the recent mass voter registration in the guise that the exercise was a civic duty. But following the closure of the registration, nearly the entire&nbsp;Cabinet&nbsp;and their PSs have appeared in key&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;platforms either in rallies or town hall meetings.Sources indicate that a coded statement from&nbsp;President&nbsp;Kenyatta during a&nbsp;Cabinet&nbsp;meeting recently may have prompted the flurry of activities being co-ordinated by the public servants. State House&rsquo;s take ALSO READ: It's my time to eat, says top witch doctor as politicians seek help ahead of election The&nbsp;President&nbsp;is said to have told&nbsp;his&nbsp;Cabinet&nbsp;that the polls were here and he was going to traverse the country to seek votes &ldquo;na nyinyi mjipange&rsquo; (organise yourselves) and said he would respect the verdict of voters. Among the most conspicuous ministers on the&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;trial are Joseph Nkaissery (Interior), Fred Matiang&rsquo;i (Education), Sicily Kariuki (Planning, Youth and Gender), Charles Keter (Energy), Mwangi Kiunjuri (Devolution), Dan Kazungu (Mining), Najib Balala (Tourism), Eugene Wamalwa (Water) Ali Wario (Sports) and Joe Mucheru (ICT). State House Spokesman Manoah Esipisu says the ministers are out there telling Kenyans what the government&nbsp;has&nbsp;done as part of the accountability question, as Kenyans expect them to tell what the administration&nbsp;has&nbsp;done as required by law. He says this should not be equated to&nbsp;campaigns. &ldquo;Secondly, they are ministers because they were appointed by the&nbsp;President&nbsp;and they are agents of the&nbsp;President&nbsp;who inform the public on the progress of implementing the key promises that the government gave during&nbsp;campaigns,&rdquo; says Esipisu. When asked if the CSs were violating the law, National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale quipped, &ldquo;The ministers were appointed by Jubilee and they are&nbsp;campaigning&nbsp;for Jubilee; is there anything wrong with that?&rdquo;&nbsp; Last weekend, Kiunjuri, Kazungu and Wamalwa not only attended a Jubilee rally in Malindi, but also addressed the forum and asked the Coast region to shun Opposition leaders and vote for Jubilee. A fortnight ago, Balala graced the Jubilee rally at Tononoka Grounds in Mombasa that was attended by&nbsp;Uhuru&nbsp;and Ruto. After the rally, the&nbsp;President&nbsp;sent another team to Opposition leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s stronghold of Kisumu last Friday to allay claims that Jubilee had sidelined the region. The team was led by JP Secretary&nbsp;General&nbsp;Raphael Tuju and CSs Wario and Mucheru.

Nkaissery&nbsp;has&nbsp;been leading Jubilee&nbsp;campaigns&nbsp;in Maasai land where people largely voted for the Opposition in 2013.
