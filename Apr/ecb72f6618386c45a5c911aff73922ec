SIAYA, KENYA: Siaya Governor Cornell Rasanga has denied&nbsp;claims by Gem MP, Jakoyo Midiwo that he made&nbsp;a secret visit&nbsp;to State House, Nairobi on Monday. Midiwo claims the governor was at State House last Monday and that one of his agenda was&nbsp;to discuss&nbsp;with President Uhuru Kenyatta the fate of the controversial Yalla Swamp, following claims the American firm, Dominion Farms was pulling out. Midiwo on Tuesday repeated&nbsp;his earlier claims that Mr Rasanga was involved in a secret moves&nbsp;to give out&nbsp;the expansive swamp to yet another investor. The Dominion group has been involved in large scale&nbsp;rice growing and fish farming.&nbsp; The Dominion group is however said to be planning to relocate from Kenya after&nbsp;its&nbsp;owner, Mr&nbsp;Calvin Burges&nbsp;differed&nbsp;with local leaders following his claims that ODM leader Raila Odinga and some MPs&nbsp;had been demanding bribes&nbsp;from him. But in a quick rejoinder Rasanga denied visiting State House and termed the allegations as blatant lies. The governor argued that it was a categorical stupid gesture from his opponents. &quot;These are the usual stupid gestures&nbsp;and accusations from my opponents,&quot; he told&nbsp;the Standard in a text message. Midiwo alleged that there was a plot by a Mombasa based&nbsp;Maize miller and another company in discussions&nbsp;with the Siaya&nbsp;County Government over the Yalla swamp.
