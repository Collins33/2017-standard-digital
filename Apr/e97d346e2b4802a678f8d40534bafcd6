NAIROBI, KENYA: The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) on Monday dismissed as inconsequential newspaper reports that NASA will announce its own results in the coming August general election. In a statement, IEBC said that it is only the Commission that is allowed under the law to count, tally, collate, announce and declare the results of an election. &ldquo;Other actors including political parties shall have access to the results within the framework established by&nbsp;the Commission,&rdquo; said Wafula Chebukati, Chairman IEBC adding that the Constitution, the Elections Act as amended and the attendant regulations provide the procedure for elections results management. Speaking at a rally in Kibera, Raila Odinga said the National Super Alliance (NASA) will announce its own results in the August polls as part of efforts to prevent rigging. He said agents would scan the result documents and relay them in real time once they are announced at every polling station by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission officials. In response IEBC further said it has developed the results management framework which is publicly available on its website. The framework clarifies the procedure the Commission shall follow in ensuring transparency and accountability in election results management.
