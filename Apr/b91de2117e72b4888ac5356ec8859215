Khwisero MP Benjamin Andola Thursday added to the growing number of legislators edged out in the ongoing ODM party primaries in Kakamega County. Andola, who had earlier garnered 6,154 votes to emerge victorious, boycotted a repeat exercise following cancellation of the results due to what Kakamega County Election Board chairman David Sasala termed glaring irregularities. Sasala said they were compelled to intervene and repeat the nominations after the primaries conducted on April 15 were marred by irregularities. Benjamin Andama was declared the winner, beating Kakamega Woman Representative Rachael Ameso to second place. Ms Ameso had protested that her strongholds in Kisa West did not vote and successfully petitioned the election board to call a repeat exercise. She had garnered 2,346 votes against Andama&rsquo;s 3,995 before they were subjected to repeat polls. Earlier, Lurambi MP Raphael Otaalo, his Butere counterpart Andrew Toboso and Silverse Anami of Shinyalu had been defeated by their rivals. Meanwhile, the Amani National Congress (ANC) called off nominations in Malava Sub-county due to election anomalies.&nbsp; ALSO READ: ODM nominees vow to send home Jubilee bigwigs
