The Government has sent three diplomats to the Middle East to help resolve abuse Kenyans are reportedly suffering in Gulf countries. &nbsp;Sammy Nyabari from the Department of Labour said the diplomats had been posted to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Qatar, where foreign workers, including Kenyans, are being abused by their employers due to lack of protective labour laws. The Government has launched a fresh crackdown on rogue employment agencies that have been facilitating Kenyans&#39; travel to these countries. &nbsp;&quot;This is aimed at curbing exploitation and abuse of Kenyans who seek jobs in Gulf countries,&quot; said Mr Nyabari. &nbsp;He said the Government was also close to sealing a deal with Qatar to improve working conditions for Kenyans.
