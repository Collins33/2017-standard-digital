NAIROBI, KENYA: Nairobi has been named intelligent city in Africa. According to an article appearing in the CNN (http://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/10/africa/nairobi-africa-intelligent-city/index.html), Kenya&rsquo;s capital city however failed to make it to the World&rsquo;s top seven finalists. According to the Intelligent Community Forum, &quot;intelligent communities&quot; are those that have taken &quot;conscious steps&quot; to create an economy that can prosper in the &quot;broadband economy.&quot; The group has recently released its latest rankings, recognizing the achievements of communities that have built inclusive, prosperous economies on a basis of information and communication technologies. Nairobi was the only African city to appear on their shortlist of 21 hubs throughout the world for 2015. Intelligent Community Forum co-founder Robert Bell says: &quot;We see a strong foundation being put into place [in Nairobi]: sensible, pro-growth government policy, a more diversified economy, and an innovation ecosystem of startups, international companies and universities.
