Former Starehe MP Bishop Margaret Wanjiru arrested and locked up at Parklands Polling Station after she allegedly destroyed election material. Wanjiru who is vying for Nairobi governor&#39;s seat stormed City Park polling centre just as the officials were closing the polling exercise at around 5:30pm. She started shouting as she destroyed election material claiming that the exercise was tilted in favor of one of her competitors. According to Nairobi County Commander Japheth Koome, Wanjiru was arrested after the returning officer called police and complained about the disruption. &quot;It is true she was arrested and locked up at Parklands Police Station. She will appear in court Thursday,&quot; added Koome. There were attempts by some of her supporters to secure her freedom and some even milled around the police station but they were chased away by the police.
