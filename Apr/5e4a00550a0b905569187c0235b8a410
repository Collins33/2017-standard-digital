One of the biggest shocker is the exit of Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru, who was actively campaigning for governorship before changing his mind to defend his seat. Former Redkyulass comedian, John Kiarie, popularly known as KJ, won the Dagoretti South Jubilee Party primaries. Mr Kiarie, who garnered 9,793 votes in the Wednesday nominations, beat Mr Waweru who garnered 9,051. KJ had run twice; 2007 and 2013, unsuccessfully. After the two attempts on an ODM ticket, KJ decamped to Jubilee Party in February 2016.
