A woman has petitioned the court to order the arrest of two people she alleges kidnapped her 17-year-old daughter, whom she claims has been recruited to join Al Shabaab. Dorey Madhifa Yusuf&nbsp;claims to have been informed by a family friend that her daughter had been sneaked out of the country to Somalia by a man and a woman. She said police initially arrested the two and took them to Pangani Police Station after she filed a complaint. Madhifa claims that the two confessed to the police that they had taken her daughter and promised to return her in three days but never did.
