It&rsquo;s&nbsp;that&nbsp;season&nbsp;again&nbsp;when&nbsp;politicians&nbsp;employ&nbsp;all&nbsp;manner&nbsp;of&nbsp;tricks&nbsp;to&nbsp;win&nbsp;elective&nbsp;seats. And as political temperatures rise, one man in Kitui County is bubbling with enthusiasm. He follows news and the direction the campaigns are taking keenly. &lsquo;Doctor&rsquo; Quick Kinyamasyo is a renowned witch doctor in Mbitini town, Kitui County. He has practised the trade for about 20 years, and claims every&nbsp;election&nbsp;period brings with it a fair share of good fortune. &ldquo;The&nbsp;politicians&nbsp;have started coming, and the number will increase&nbsp;when&nbsp;the campaigns intensify,&rdquo; he says. On a good day, he can see 300 &lsquo;patients,&rsquo; with some traveling from as far as Uganda and Tanzania. He charges Sh1,000 as consultation fee and after diagnosing what is ailing the &lsquo;patient,&rsquo; be it evil spirits, bewitching, dark spells, and other malaise, he treats and makes the individual promise to pay more&nbsp;when&nbsp;they &lsquo;recover.&rsquo; His political clients come with desire to subdue their competitors. Some seek immunity from evil that their enemies might be plotting. &ldquo;I cannot reveal names, but most of them need my protection&nbsp;when&nbsp;they are vying for political&nbsp;seats,&rdquo; he tells Saturday Standard. The protection from evil is in form of an oath dubbed &lsquo;Ngata&rsquo;. It is an elaborate ritual where the witch doctor serves clients a meal of arterial blood and intestines of a goat specially prepared to symbolise the beginning of a new life &ndash; where the client gets eternal protection from evil. &lsquo;Dr Quick&rsquo; claims the Ngata is so potent that most of his political clients always triumph. &ldquo;Ngata works and you only need to believe to see how much it can change your life,&rdquo; he says.

Dr Quick&rsquo; says in most cases, it is their political rivals, family and friends jealous of their progress and other forces they think might hinder them from clinching the&nbsp;seat. Then they take the oath dubbed ngata, with a vow not to shower for three days, nor engage in any form of witchcraft. Clients must also vow to pay after succeeding. &ldquo;Some misfortunes that happen to&nbsp;politicians&nbsp;are due to bewitching and my role is to dilute it,&rdquo; he says. Interestingly,&nbsp;when&nbsp;he gets two clients vying for the same&nbsp;seat, he consults with the spirits to see who will&nbsp;win, and sends one away. &ldquo;I tell the one I suspect will lose to seek other witch doctors, and it then becomes a battle of witch doctors, not between&nbsp;politicians,&rdquo; he admits. The 46-year-old claims he was born with the gift of a seer and witch doctor. He comes from a generation of traditional healers, and after finishing secondary school, joined the practise as &ldquo;he could no longer ignore the forces working inside him.&rdquo; &ldquo;When&nbsp;you are gifted, the force moves you and you cannot escape it. I would get dreams, and hear voices telling me to start healing people,&rdquo; he says. Today, he boasts of a vast clientele, saying he gets invites and flight tickets to travel and &lsquo;treat people.&rsquo; Nairobi has so far given him most clients. He wears a suit and carries a briefcase full of paraphernalia&nbsp;when&nbsp;called upon to exorcise evil spirits in an office, or help one get a promotion. &ldquo;I have visited many offices in Nairobi to clean things up. People don&rsquo;t recognise that I am a witch doctor&nbsp;when&nbsp;I wear my suit,&rdquo; he says, letting out a hearty laugh. Despite his popularity on social media, however, there are mixed feelings on whether his &lsquo;powers&rsquo; work. &ldquo;What nonsense is that? He&nbsp;tricks&nbsp;ignorant people who want to succeed quickly and don&rsquo;t want to work hard,&rdquo; says one trader.
