Nakumatt Supermarket&#39;s long serving director Thiagarajan Ramamurthy has exited the retailer, just months before a major shakeup. Nakumatt Managing Director Atul Shah said the strategy will feature a new group and regional management structure featuring Chief Officers at the Nairobi regional headquarters complemented by in-country management teams in Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. &ldquo;The management programme to be undertaken through the next few months will feature further enhancements on the firm&rsquo;s C-suite and regional operations management teams,&rdquo; Mr Shah said. The recently appointed Chief Marketing Officer, Andrew Dixon, assisted by the Regional Chief Officers, has assumed duties previously undertaken by Ramamurthy to facilitate a seamless transition. The retailer has hired UK&rsquo;s Outram Cullinan &amp; Company (OC&amp;C) Strategy consultant to develop a ten-year growth plan. Nakumatt has also retained Information Technology Consulting firm Zensar to spearhead its IT re-engineering process.
