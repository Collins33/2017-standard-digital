 Dr Kaniaru said the victims delayed to seek treatment.
 Two of the deaths and 27 of the infections were reported in October.
  "Tests done to water samples that were taken from water sources and home taps and taken to the government chemist and Water Resource Management Authority (Warma) laboratories revealed that most of the water sources had been contaminated with fecal matter. From the tests, the likelihood cause of outbreak is water and not food," he said.
 Speaking during World toilet day celebrations in Kanduri village, Embu East Sub County, Dr Kaniaru said cholera was still active in the County and since the beginning of the month, a few random cases had been received.
  He said cholera treatment centres are still operational at the Embu Level 5 Hospital and, Kiritiri, Gategi and Siakago health centres
 The official raised alarm over the high number of households that lack latrines especially in Mbeere North Sub County.
