Police Friday seized a generator worth Sh2.5 million belonging to the county government of Tharaka Nithi at a property owned by a former governor.
 According to police sources, the generator was found installed at a hotel in the county headquarters of Kathwana allegedly owned by the former Governor Samuel Ragwa.
 Police sources said the former governor appears to have diverted to private use the generator after it and another one were donated by a non-governmental organization when the former governor was in charge.
 A county government technical officer claimed the other generator was sent to a hospital while the one in contention had been reserved for use in the county headquarters from where it disappeared mysteriously.

 The police sources also indicated that it was the former governor who had called the county government officers asking them to pick up the equipment allegedly because he had borrowed it for use until after the general elections.
 “We are in consultation with the county government on whether they wanted to prefer charges against the former governor or whether they wanted the matter to rest after the recovery,” said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
