A poll loser has accused Embakasi East MP Babu Owino of threatening a poll officer in the August 8 General Election.
 Mbugua Mureithi, a Jubilee candidate challenging Babu Owino's win, yesterday also said most forms 35B were not signed by returning officers and one could not tell whether they were fake or genuine.

 He was being cross-examined by both defence and his lawyers. Mureithi said some polling stations like Soweto and Spring Valley Primary schools were marred with violence.
 He told the court Mr Owino announced himself as winner after he threatened the returning officer.
 “Babu Owino was caught on camera bribing voters with money at Greenspan polling stations and the video is in court,” he said.
 He claimed his agents were not allowed to enter a tallying centre at East African of Aviation.
 Mureithi accused Owino of threatening and intimidating the returning officer.
 At Embakasi Social Hall stream seven and Soweto Social Hall number five the results according to Muriithi were altered.
