Video footage released by Cable News Network (CNN) last week showing migrants being sold off at an auction in Tripoli, Libya has sparked a heated debate worldwide.
 The footage released by CNN appeared to show youths from Niger and other sub-Saharan countries being sold to buyers for about $400 (£300) at undisclosed locations in Libya.
 Libyan authorities have launched formal investigations into slave auctions in the country.?
 According to AFP, Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Metig said his UN-backed Government of National Accord would investigate the allegations, in a statement posted Sunday on the Facebook page of the GNA's press office.

 The statement further read, "I will instruct the formation of a commission to investigate these reports in order to apprehend and bring those responsible to justice.''
 The chaos ridden nation has long been a major transit hub for migrants trying to reach Europe, and many of them have fallen prey to serious abuse in the North African country at the hands of traffickers.
