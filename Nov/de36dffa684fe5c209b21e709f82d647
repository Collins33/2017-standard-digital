Teams representing the country in various seven-a-side rugby tournaments have a small window to get it right before the new season kicks off in a few weeks. The Kenya Simbas will be the first team to taste action on November 10 when the Hong Kong Cup of Nations kicks off in Asia, followed shortly by the national sevens team’s engagement in the HSBC Sevens World Series in Dubai from December 1.
 Commendably, the Kenya Sevens team seems to be taking its assignments seriously and has chosen to relocate the training venue to a high altitude fitness camp in Nanyuki to focus on physical conditioning. This out-of-the-box thinking is what engenders success — it is widely believed that training at high altitude stimulates a more efficient use of oxygen by the muscles and builds on endurance when competing at sea level.
