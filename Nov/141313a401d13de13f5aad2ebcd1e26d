 However, this is not the first time the Meru senator has suffered such a huge blow.

 The petitioner in question, Mugambi Imanyara has been contesting the election of Mr Linturi as the Meru senator.
 Linturi was among the 106 political leaders in the list of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to have questionable integrity issues ahead of the August 8 general election.
