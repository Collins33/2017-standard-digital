Leaders from the Coast region publicly differed on calls for secession in a meeting on Monday.
 The secession debate, mooted by Mombasa Governor Hassan Ali Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi, has split public opinion in the region.

 During a tree planting exercise on Monday, Taita Taveta Senator Jones Mwaruma and MPs Jones Mlolwa and Danson Mwashako supported secession.
 “Those talking about secession have valid reasons and should not be ignored. There are bad things going on in the country and that is why the coastal region is advocating to govern itself,” argued Jones Mlolwa.

 But Environment and Natural Resources Principal Secretary Margaret Mwakima, former Taita-Taveta County Governor John Mruttu and Jubilee branch chairman Zahid Din opposed the idea, saying politicians agitating for secession were out to create political instability in the cosmopolitan region.
 “Session has been passed by time and the coastal communities should shun it as it will bring tribal and political hatred among Kenyans. Why look at boundaries, which have brought hatred and instability in other countries,” argued Dr Mwakima.
 Opponents of secession however supported the formation of the Jumuiya ya kaunti za Pwani (JKP), an outfit bringing together all Coast counties.
 They castigated proponents of secession, saying it would divide the country and create political instability.
 Other leaders in the region supporting secession include Mwatate MP Andrew Mwadime. Governor Granton Samboja is yet to declare his stand.
