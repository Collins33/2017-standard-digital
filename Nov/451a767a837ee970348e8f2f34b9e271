Citizens will at specific times access roads marked ‘red zones’ during today’s swearing-in of President-elect Uhuru Kenyatta.
 Nairobi County Police Commander Japheth Koome said the main roads would only be cordoned off when a dignitary is passing after which it will be opened again for the public.

 “Motorists can find alternative routes to reduce traffic. However, the roads will be open to the public when there are no dignitaries passing,” he said.
 Mr Koome also asked the public not to panic as the road will only be out of use at specific times and the ceremony is expected to end in good time to open up the closed routes.

 “The public are invited to attend the swearing-in ceremony at Kasarani... You are, however, expected to have settled by 9am before the dignitaries start streaming in. The roads will still be accessible then,” he said.
 Koome also said they do not expect a traffic snarl-up in the city since the day will be a holiday.
 The county boss, however, issued a strong warning to road users who would cause trouble along the marked roads, saying they will be face the full force of the law.
 A multi-agency team drawn from the police, county inspectorate and military would be involved in providing  security.
 “The red-zoned roads will have maximum security. Any breach of the law will be dealt with firmly. The security of more than 20 Heads of State and other dignitaries cannot be compromised,” he said.
 Among the dignitaries expected in the county is Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose last visit to the country caused uproar on social media due to heavy traffic snarl-up caused by the extreme security details accorded to him.
