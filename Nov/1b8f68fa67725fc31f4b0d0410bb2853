The National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) has warned of looming land conflict at the border of Nandi and Kakamega counties.
 NCIC is now calling on Lands Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi to resolve the stalemate between the two communities living along the Nandi Escarpment before the situation gets out of hand.

 Speaking in Kakamega town after meeting elders from the Nandi and Kakamega counties, NCIC boss in charge of the two counties Richard Shiyonga said trouble started after residents on the Kakamega side were issued with tile deeds while those from Nandi were left out.
 “Violence erupts every year along the border where lives are lost and property destroyed. We are appealing to Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and his Nandi counterpart Stephen Sang to hold a joint peace forum to reach a consensus on how to solve the stalemate,” said Mr Shiyonga.

 He said tension was high in the area and appealed to Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to consider putting up a police post along the border at Kuvasili.
 NCIC vice-chairperson Irene Wanyoike warned politicians against preaching hate messages in the area.
