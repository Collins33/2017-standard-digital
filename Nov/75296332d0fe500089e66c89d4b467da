Drama unfolded at Sugoi Girls  Secondary School in Uasin Gishu County after a group of boys from the nearby Turbo Boys were arrested as they attempted to gain access into the institution at night.
 The boys made their way into the school and headed to the girls' dormitories under the cover of darkness unaware that that security officers, who had been made alerted of the plan were waiting for them.
 Uasin Gishu County Director of Education (CDE) Nicodemus Anyang said that security officers were tipped off by area chief over the mission, suspected to have been a 'sex escapade' organised in connivance with the girls.
 “Apparently the boys sneaked out of school on Friday evening after finishing their exams. They went to a local pub where they imbibed alcohol and hatched a plot to invade the school for sex,” said the CDE.

 Anyang said that the boys were attempting to rape the girls but security apparatus were alert noting that there was no prior contact between the students from the two schools before incident only that the boys were 'trying their luck'.
 “The girls had been rounded up and assembled at the dining hall as police officers strategically positioned themselves to waylay the marauding boys,” said the educational official.
 He said that fifteen of the boys were arrested and taken to police station but were bailed out to enable them continue writing the exams which are to officially to end today (Wednesday).
 He said the girls did not come into contact with the boys following the swift action of the security officers and the school administration.
