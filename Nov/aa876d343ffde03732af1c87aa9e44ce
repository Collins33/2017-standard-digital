 Ex- Kamukunji MP Simon Mbugua who relinquished the fiercely contested Kamukunji Jubilee primaries in what he owed to ‘wide consultations with the party hierarchy’ has also been nominated along former MPs Wanjiku Muhia (Nyandarua), Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East), Abdulaziz Ali and Adan Mohamed (Mandera North).
 Others nominated to the list include Irene Cherop, Julie Njeri, Florence Sergon, Justin Bundi, Elizabeth Wangui, Joe Muriithi, Dorice Donya, Eunice Wanjiru and Jackson Kosgei.
 This is as Parliament is yet to receive the list from the opposition.
 EALA failed to kick off business on June 4 after it was crippled by Kenya’s failure to give her nominees to the regional Assembly. The other five member countries have had their nominees sworn in.
