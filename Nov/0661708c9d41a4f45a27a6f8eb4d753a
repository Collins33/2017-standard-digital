 According to a village elder, the suspect warned his son not to relieve himself in the basin but when the three-year-old did so repeatedly, the man took a knife and cut part of the boy’s genitals.
 “This is the most inhuman act we have seen in this village in years and the residents wanted to lynch the suspect but police arrived in time and took him to the station,” the elder said.

 He termed the suspect as unsound of mind, adding that he had never had any confrontation with the villagers.
 Esther Njeri, a child rights activist, condemned the act, terming it inhuman and called for a prohibitive action on the suspect. Njeri, a former nominated MCA, said the minor was taken to Naivasha sub-county hospital.
 “Stern action must be taken against the suspect and we will follow the matter to its logical conclusion so that the innocent minor can get justice,” she said.
 Ms Njeri, who has for years been at the forefront in advocating for children’s rights, said cases of child abuse were reducing. “We conducted public awareness... and the results are positive,” she said.
