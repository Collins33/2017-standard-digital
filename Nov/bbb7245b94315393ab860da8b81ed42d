 Mr Kosgei said the body was discovered by another boy from the same school. Kosgei said the police had launched investigations, noting that the boy appeared to have been too young to commit suicide.
 "Ironically, the parents wanted to rush and bury the body before the postmortem analysis was done but we declined the request," said the OCPD.
