A-30-year-old man is nursing serious injuries after he was attacked by a crocodile.
 George Onyango was crossing River Kuja in Bungu village, Ndhiwa sub-county, on Wednesday evening when the reptile attacked.
 “The crocodile grabbed him by the waist and tossed him in the air. Luckily, instead of falling into the water, he fell on the river bank,” said a witness.
 Villagers stoned the crocodile to prevent it from dragging Mr Onyango back into the river.

 Residents said the number of crocodile attacks in the area had risen and appealed to the county government to build bridges across the river to protect residents from further danger.
