 Later, the body will leave for his Kirichu home in a function closed to the public over availability of space. His fellow governors will be the pallbearers as the body is interred.
 Governor Wahome Gakuru died in a grisly road accident at Kabati along Thika-Murangá road on November 7.
 Described by many as a technocrat, Gakuru died aged 51 year old, barely two months after taking office. He will be accorded a state burial with his coffin draped with the Kenyan flag.
