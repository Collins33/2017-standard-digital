A key witness in a petition challenging the election of Yatta MP Charles Kilonzo has told a Machakos Court that poll results were altered by a returning officer.
 Samuel Mulei, who was a polling agent of Chama Cha Uzalendo party (CCU) on whose ticket the petitioner, former MP Francis Mwangangi, vied claimed Yatta RO made alterations to forms 35 A and 35 B and also denied party agents the opportunity to sign the forms.
