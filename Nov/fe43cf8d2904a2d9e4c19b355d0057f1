Former governor Samuel Ragwa has denied that a generator owned by the county government was found on his premises illegally.
 Police last Friday seized the generator worth Sh2.5 million at a hotel owned by the former county chief. 
 But Mr Ragwa now claims the whole saga was politically motivated and ochestrated by county government officers who thought he was still in politics.
 "The current governor (Muthomi Njuki) and his soldiers think I'm still in politics. As a result they will do as much as possible to ensure they paint me in the most negative way possible," he said.

 Ragwa said the generator was donated to the county government by Ahadi Kenya in 2014 but the organisation later borrowed it for use when they held a seminar at his Summerton Hotel.
 He said during the seminar, the transformer at the hotel was faulty.
 "Ahadi Kenya had closed its office and we had agreed they would donate some of the equipment they were using to us as the county government. We made an agreement and we acquired two generators and a printer worth Sh80,000," he said.
 "The generators were not even operational when we were getting them from the Ahadi Kenya and we had to repair one of them, which cost us about Sh186,000," he added.
 He said that after the seminar, the generator continued to be at the hotel as it was being used by staff from the county offices who were staying at the facility.
 "I am in the process of declaring my wealth and that is why I called them to come for the generator. But it was surprising to see how they went ambushing everyone at the hotel asking for (it)," he said.
