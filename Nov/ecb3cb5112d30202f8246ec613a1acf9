Ford Kenya, a National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition affiliate party has dismissed as fake, a letter making rounds across social media alleging the party had agreed to initiate consultations to work with the ruling Jubilee party.
 The sham letter bearing the party’s official logo, maintained that the opposition party under a Ford-Kenya Parliamentary Group had agreed to attend the November 28, swearing in of President-Elect Uhuru Kenyatta.
