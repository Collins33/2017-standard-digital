It may soon be illegal for anyone in the county below 21 years to drink alcohol if a bill set to be tabled in the county assembly becomes law.
 The Kiambu County Alcoholic Drink Control Bill 2017 is proposing 21 years as the minimum age any person will be allowed to consume or even sell alcohol.

 Those who go against the law, should it be enacted, will be liable upon conviction to a fine of Sh150,000 or one year in prison.
 Alcohol dealers
 The bill, which is set to replace the Kiambu County Alcoholic Drinks Control Act 2013, also makes it unlawful for alcohol dealers to allow persons under 21 to enter or gain access to areas where the alcohol is manufactured, stored, sold or consumed.
 Any person who contravenes this provision will be fined Sh250,000 or serve a one-year jail term.
 Retailers of alcoholic drinks will be required to post signs informing the public that the sale of alcohol to persons under the age of 21 is prohibited by law or be liable upon conviction to a Sh50,000 fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both.
 The bill proposes hefty penalties for anyone who manufactures, sells or distributes illegal alcohol.
