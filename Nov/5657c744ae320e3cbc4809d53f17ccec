Former Kiambu governor William Kabogo has returned to court to fight a directive to pay a city businessman Sh100 million in damages for trespass.
 Mr Kabogo has filed a notice of appeal seeking to overturn a decision by Justice Elijah Obaga that he used forged documents to claim a Sh3.5 billion plot in Nairobi.

Kabogo ordered to give back Sh3.5 billion land

 On October 31, the Land and Environment Court judge ordered Kabogo to pay Aster Holdings Director Nayan Patel, the legitimate owner of the 7.5-acre land, Sh100 million for illegal possession and trespass, bringing to an end a decade-old tussle for the plot.
 But through his lawyer Nelson Havi, the former governor is now asking the High Court to issue an injunction to stop the execution of the orders pending his appeal in the superior court.

 “On the 31st October, 2017, the court determined the dispute over property LR No 1870/V/6 in favour of Aster, directing... the cancellation of the title held by Carogate, payment of general damages of Sh100 million to the plaintiff and that Carogate delivers vacant possession of the property to Aster Holdings. Carogate is aggrieved by the entire decision of the High Court and has lodged a Notice of Appeal against the same," read Kabogo’s application.
 Carogate Investment is owned by the former county chief.
