The county government of Nakuru is seeking Sh420 million for construction of 12,000 toilets as it gears to attain Open Defecation Free (ODF) status by 2020.
 This came as it emerged that the county is losing Sh972 million annually due to poor sanitation, with diarrhea cases among children being on the increase.

 According to Deputy Governor Eric Korir, construction of modern toilets would save the county government the high cost of treatment, lost man-hours and deaths occasioned by poor sanitation.
 “To date, 300 villages in the county have been declared ODF and we are on course to celebrate another 66 in Naivasha and a further 140 in Rongai and Subukia sub-counties,” said Dr Korir after opening one of the modern toilets in Naivasha.

 County Director of Water Johnson Kamau said the devolved government had constructed close to 9,800 toilets through the various water and sanitation companies in all urban areas of the county.
 Kamau said in Naivasha alone, 500 toilets had been constructed with the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with Sh27 million spent in the expansion of the local sewer line.
