It was a concert that brought out the best in our politicians.
 Senators Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet) and Susan Kihika (Nakuru), and Jubilee Party Secretary General Raphael Tuju were all lost in praise.
 Murkomen raised his hands in worship as celebrated American gospel artiste Don Moen belted out one song after another.
 Opposition leaders including Nairobi and Busia counties women reps Esther Passaris and Florence Mutua respectively, and Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo sang and danced along to the gospel tunes.

 Former senators Joyce Lay and Joy Gwendo were not left behind in the praise feast.
 Full house
 They joined thousands of Kenyans last week at Christ Is The Answer Ministries, Karen where Moen, an American singer, songwriter, pastor and producer, sang alongside his bosom friend Lenny LeBlanc.
 The totally sold out event was also graced by other artistes among them Mercy Masika, The Worship Factory, Adawnage Band and Rebekah Dawn.
 The show that started at 6pm until 11.30pm saw the 10,000-seater hall full.
 Dispels rumours
 Don Moen prayed for the country over the political stalemate. Moen, who was dressed in a white African shirt designed by local designer Carol Pulei, called on Kenyans to be united.
 “Many other countries are also facing similar issues and there is need to stay united,” said the 66-year-old singer, who came with a crew of eight.
 He also took the chance to dispel rumours that he had divorced his wife of 44 years, Laura.
  “I am still happily married and love my wife who has been a great support to my ministry,” he said.
