The High Court in Nanyuki has allowed the inclusion of testimonies by five witnesses cited by a petitioner who had withdrawn from the petition challenging Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi’s election. The five witnesses had sworn affidavits in the petition initially filed by two voters, Sammy Ndung'u and Dennis Leman. However, Mr Leman withdrew from the matter, leaving Mr Ndung'u as the sole petitioner. Former Governor Joshua Irungu has sought to join the petition as an interested party. Governor Muriithi had sought to have all evidence linked to Leman expunged soon after the court allowed him to withdraw on November 9.
