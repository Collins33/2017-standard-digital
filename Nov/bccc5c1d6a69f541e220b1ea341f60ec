The Meteorological Department has issued a warning that the current rains will run into December. In some places, there have been flash floods and mudslides as well as washed off sections of roads and bridges.
 Sadly on numerous occasions, our disaster preparedness has been wanting. Measures put in place to mitigate against the carnage caused by the rains failed. And so generally, the onset of rains induces a certain amount of fear, especially in city dwellers living in flood-prone areas. Hopefully, the rains will not be a cause for so much misery this time round.

 Incidentally, the rains have come at a time when large sections of the country have experienced severe drought and food shortages, occasioning starvation and even death of livestock. So while regretting the death and damage the rain has caused so far, it is also prudent to see the silver lining in the dark storm clouds.
 The rains also provide us with the opportunity to ascertain whether the Northern Water Collector Tunnels are funneling water into the water reservoirs supplying water to Nairobi.

 Putting the rains to good use should be of primary importance for everyone, especially in agriculture-rich areas. More importantly, it behoves the public and the Government to initiate serious and sustainable measures of harvesting rainwater for domestic use and irrigation purposes.
 A lot of rain water goes to waste when harvesting it could contribute immensely to food sufficiency and alleviating the growing water shortage problem, especially in urban centres.
