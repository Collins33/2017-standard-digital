There was drama at the Siaya High Court during the hearing of an election petition against Governor Cornell Rasanga, after his lawyers claimed the petitionerâ€™s witnesses were using witchcraft.
 Rasanga's lawyer Nicholas Ombija complained that some of the petitioner's (Nicholas Gumbo) witnesses were chewing weird things.

 Ombija complained to Justice Esther Maina that Gumbo's supporters sprinkled strange liquid around the court room.
 "My client is not comfortable with these things they are chewing," Ombija said. But Gumbo's lawyer, Ogutu Mboya dismissed Ombija's claims as far-fetched.

 "I am the one who informed my learned friend Ombija about the incident," argued Mboya. The judge directed the said witnesses to stop chewing while on the dock.
