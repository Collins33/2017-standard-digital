Divers at the ongoing search mission at Lake Nakuru have pulled out because of lack of adequate resources.
 Nine divers from Bomet County Government and nine fishermen from Fisheries Department in Naivasha pulled out on Friday evening, leaving only Kenya Navy and Kenya Divers Rescue Divers who are sponsored by Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko.

 The Kenya Navy team are working with experts from the Mining ministry to locate the debris and recover the bodies.
 The National Disaster Operation Centre (NDOC) desk officer, Mr Jonathan Kertich, who is in-charge of the operation said the fishermen pulled out because they were catering for their own accommodation and other expenses.

 “Most divers volunteered their resources to help in the recovery of the bodies and debris but are financially constrained,” said Kertich.
 The fishermen from Naivasha left with their two boats that have been stationed at the lake since search mission commenced on October 21.
 They were reportedly being sponsored by Senator Susan Kihika.
 The Bomet team were volunteers and did not anticipate the exercise would take longer.
 “Divers from Bomet come to provide their services voluntarily but have promised to come back,” he said.
 As divers pulled out, former Nacada chairman John Mututho has accused the county government of poor waste management, which he said has hampered the recovery exercise.
