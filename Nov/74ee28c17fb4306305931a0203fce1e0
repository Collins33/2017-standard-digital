Why Uhuru now wants dialogue with Raila

 Nicholas Mrima Wanyepe, who contested the party’s primaries early this year but was defeated by current Kilifi South MP Ken Chonga was arrested on Saturday in Mtwapa and transferred to Kilifi Police Station.
 Police said he was arrested for possessing material that may incite the public against the Government. But local activists said Wanyepe was detained for handing out NASA’s branded National Resistance Movement NRM T-shirts.

 Kilifi County Commander Ben Kogo said Wanyepe would be arraigned in court today.
 “I am out of Kilifi but that is what I was briefed. He is in custody and we shall take him to court on Monday,” said Kogo.
 According to Charles Omollo, a youth leader from Kilifi, Wanyepe was arrested while coming from church.
 “According to the charges, the police claim he knows where NASA leader Raila Odinga will be sworn in,” said Omolo.
 Kilifi County NASA coordinator Leah Akech said the arrest was a ploy to intimidate and silence vocal National Super Alliance (NASA) leaders in the county. Ms Akech, who has since gone into hiding, said many ODM youth leaders from the county feared for their lives and had gone underground.
