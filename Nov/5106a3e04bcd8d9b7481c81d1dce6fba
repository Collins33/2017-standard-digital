 “The chopper has made the first trip at around 1024 hours and will be coming back to pick more exam papers for the affected schools”, said Ms. Libere.
 
 According to the Mwingi OCPD Patrick Okeri, the heavy rainfall that has been experienced in most parts of the lower Eastern has rendered roads impassable. He added that on Monday 13, police officers and exam officials were forced to walk to various schools after the vehicle they were using got stuck in a flooded river.
 “The rivers are flooded thus making the schools inaccessible, on Monday police officers were forced to escort the examination materials on foot across the rivers to the schools to enable the candidates’ sit for the day’s papers “said Okeri
