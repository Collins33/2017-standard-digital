 This is after the team of lawyers led by Waweru Gatonye representing the governor withdrew from the case.
 The lawyers stormed out of the court room after their request for adjournment to prepare more application against the case was denied.

 Recently on November 10, 2017; High court judge Justice Aggrey Muchelule dismissed an application by Mutua seeking to dismiss the petition filled by his vicious competitor Wavinya Ndeti.
 “A complaint against the election of the governor is essentially against the deputy governor as the IEBC does not conduct separate election for the two positions. If the petitioner does not contest the election of the DG, the petitioner cannot sustain a petition against the Governor,” argued Mutua in the dismissed application.
 Grounds that Justice Aggrey Muchelule ruled was ‘irredeemably and fatally defective’ and failed to meet the legal threshold to warrant a dismissal.
 Former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti has been challenging Mutua’s win on ground of massive irregularities. She alleges massive rigging and failure to sign forms 37A, 37B, and 37C as required by electoral laws.
 The case is set to continue on November 30, 2017 after Governor Mutua requested for time to hire a new legal team.
