 
 Police have banned a planned protest in Bomet town against Governor Joyce Laboso over termination of contracts for employees hired by former Governor Isaac Ruto. Bomet County Commissioner Erastus Ekidor said no protest would be authorised by police because the matter on termination of contracts was still in court. Mr Ekidor on Monday also warned Bomet Central MP Ronald Tonui, who is said to be behind the planned protest, against inciting the public.
