Jubilee and NASA leaders clashed over who played a role in the Mumias Sugar Company woes. Jubilee leaders claimed NASA co-principal and Senate Minority Leader Moses Wetang’ula was behind problems facing the miller.
 Speaking during the funeral service of Thomas Aseka, son of Mumias' Managing Director Nashon Aseka at Sabatia, Butere, they accused Wetang’ula of being among people who sold the company’s land in Busia County for Sh40 million.

 Former ODM national youth leader Rashid Mohammed who contested and lost Mumias West MP Seat on Jubilee ticket claimed that some of the local politicians contributed to the near collapse of the company.
 “The company land was sold at Sh40 million by some of our leaders. I cannot hide it, Wetang’ula was part of the people who sold the piece of land belonging to the company,” said Mr Mohammed.

 Wetang’ula, who also attended the funeral, dismissed the claims saying Jubilee had failed to revive the company and was instead focusing on writing off debts owed to coffee farmers at the expense of cane farmers.
