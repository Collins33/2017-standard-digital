Many described him as a consummate peace crusader who went out of his way to ensure cohesion and unity among different communities across the country.
 But to his family in Segutiet village, Bomet County, Catholic Diocese of Eldoret Bishop Rev Cornelius Korir was a pillar of wise counsel and human virtues.

 The prelate’s family members, who travelled from their ancestral home in Bomet to Eldoret after his sudden death on Monday morning, said they lack words to describe the loss of a man who had dedicated his life to serving God and humanity.
 Raphael Kipsoi, an older brother of Bishop Korir, said the family was in shock since the cleric had taken a leadership role in the family and the entire community.

 Religious leader
 “We never saw him as a religious leader because he wanted the best for everybody without thinking of one’s second name or social status in the family and the entire community. He was very mindful of the family progress and for the community and had initiated several projects such as Segutiet water project and the construction of Segutiet Secondary School,” said Mr Kipsoi.
 He said Bishop Korir’s unmatched generosity and peace-making had manifested itself since childhood.
 “He was a cut above the rest and whenever a disagreement emerged among his peers, he would simply walk away from trouble after offering counsel to the conflicting parties,” he recalls.
 Pauline Mosonik, Bishop Korir’s sister, described him as a father figure to the family and a close confidant.
 “We are pondering what to do as a family since we have lost a dependable figure. On the fateful day, I had booked an executive room at Karen Hospital and even bought an air ticket for him and even sent a vehicle to pick him up from the airport,” recalled Ms Mosonik.
