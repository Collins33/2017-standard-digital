 In an alert to motorists, the authority says Ngong Road from City Mortuary roundabout to Kenya National Library service in Upper Hill will be closed to allow surface works along that section.
 The first phase of construction aimed that expanding the busy Ngong Road into a dual carriageway was launched in August 2016 and was due for completion in July, 2017.

 Expected to ease traffic along that road, the 2.6 kilometre stretch cost Sh1.3 billion. The project, which is sponsored by a grant from the Japanese government, seeks to break ground for a bus rapid transport or light railway to be built later.
 However, the Japanese contractor World Kaihatsu Kogyo Ltd. ran months late owing to challenges of shifting of water and power lines along the road.
 KURA has requested motorists to use alternative routes during that period.
