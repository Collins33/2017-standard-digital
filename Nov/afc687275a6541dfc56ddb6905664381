Voters in Kitutu Chache South are today voting belatedly after the electoral commission put off the poll following the death of Jubilee candidate Leonard Gwaro Mwamba in July, meaning the constituency did not vote on August 2017.
 The 115 polling stations opened as early as 6pm to a low voter turnout.

 Voters braved showers and muddy roads and many of them had cast their votes by 10am.
 The first to vote was Wiper Party's Andrew Maubi at Nyatieko Primary followed by Ford Kenya's Richard Onyonka at Soko Primary. Jubilee party's Anthony Kibagendi has voted at Nyamataro Polling center.

 They all expressed confidence in winning the seat that has been held by Onyonka in the last two parliamentary terms.
 The constituency has a total of 59,079 registered voters with seven candidates battling it out to win the seat.
 Constituency Returning officer Hilda Imbo had to testify in an election petition before she proceeded for the exercise.
 Ms Imbo was appearing in court as an IBEC witness on an election petition challenging the election of Senator Sam Ongeri.
 However she said that everything was moving on as planned despite a few challenges she described as normal.
 "So far we have not encountered any major challenge. We hope the rains will subside to enable us access all polling stations after the exercise," said Ms Imbo.
