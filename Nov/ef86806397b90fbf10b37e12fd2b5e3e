National Building Inspectorate has issued an evacuation notice to tenants of a five-storey building in Kisii two weeks after another building collapsed in the area leading to the death of seven people.
 In line with Disaster Prevention and Mitigation measures, an evacuation was ordered from the unstable building in Mwembe estate.

 Tenants were advised to vacate the residential building following reports that it had developed cracks. But as other tenants were evacuating the building, more than 20 others could not access their rooms because the landlord had locked them over rent arrears.
 Area chief George Mogaka said they will not allow the landlord to hold tenants at ransom.

 “We have to save lives fist. The other issues can be discussed at a later date. We have legally recognised bodies that can deal with other arising issues,” said Mr Mogaka.
 Several tenants in adjacent buildings were also forced to vacate their houses for safety.
 Yesterday National Building Inspectorate and National Construction Authority officials said they were investigating the status of the said building. National Disaster Management Unit Deputy Director Pius Masai called on members of the public to keep off the site.
 “The building should be cordoned off from the public,” said Masai.
 Kisii County engineer Oyaro Kenyoru said tenants had complained that the building had visible cracks.
 “Preliminary visual assessment indicates undue vibration on the floors and stairs. The equilibrium is suspect,” said Mr Kenyoru.
 According to the Secretary National Building Inspectorate Mr Moses Nyakiongora, tenants have a duty to report to the authorities any poorly constructed buildings.
 “We have done an audit and established that more than nine buildings in Kisii should be demolished,” said Mr Nyakiongora.
