The Government has pledged Sh16 billion to improve fisheries through aquaculture in Kwale and other parts of the coastal strip.
 Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett said the funding would be done through a partnership with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).

 Speaking at Shimoni in Lungalunga Sub-County, Kwale County, during the marking of International Fisheries Day, Bett said the project would target training and creating awareness on caged fish production.
 “The awareness will also help increase the rate at which people in the country consume fish," he said.

 The CS said the Government would focus on creating and sustaining internal fish market before expanding to the export market.
 He said caged fishing could easily reduce the cost of production and called on coastal people to embrace fish ponds as much as they did sea fishing.
 “Let us start ponds at our homes so that we can improve fish production. The funds that are coming will train you on best technology to do fish ponds,” he said.
