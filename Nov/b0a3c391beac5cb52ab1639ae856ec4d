 The OCPD added that police has been searching for the officer for the past two weeks and that when he is arrested, he will be charged withr defilement and involvement in procuring an abortion.
 Run away
 “When ones commits an offence he will run away. And this is serious, it is not a petty offence and so he must be on the run. My area OCS is still pursuing the suspect. We are trucking his phone. Some of his numbers are on and others have been switched off,” he said.
 The Standard established that a requisition letter to compel the officer to go to Kilifi Police Station on November 16, 2017, was delivered to his office on November 14.
 However, the man went underground.
 The victim's father, a casual worker in Shanzu, said he was summoned by the head teacher, who informed him of his daughter's disciplinary cases.
