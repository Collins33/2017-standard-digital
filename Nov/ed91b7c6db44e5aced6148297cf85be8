 “The only gift I can afford are these pieces of cane. We are grateful that cane farming is now profitable, thanks to his (President Uhuru) efforts,” said Ogoti.

 He said even although it would be his first time to Nairobi, his friends had informed him that he should alight at the Country Bus stage in Nairobi.
 “I will then link up with one of my relatives to take me to the event. I have confidence that I will reach him (Uhuru) and present my gift,” he said.
 The Standard caught up with him at his Mayala home in Mumias while making final preparations for the journey.
 According to him, he had uprooted cane from hisland due to lack of payment but after the Government bailed out the company, he was now benefiting from cane farming.
 The State has so far injected Sh3.7 billion into the cash-strapped Mumias Sugar Company, which was on the verge of closure after it failed to meet its financial obligations.
 In July, President Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto delivered a Sh500 million cheque to pay farmers and the cash was partly used for maintenance of the factory.

 The miller which reopened a month ago after eight months of closure is now crushing cane and has changed its marketing strategy to persuade more farmers to plant cane.
 The company now pays farmers within seven days of delivering their cane to the factory, a strategy that is working well for the miller.
 “Farmers are our key stakeholders, we are now paying them on time so that we can win back their trust to supply cane to Mumias. With the new management , I have confidence the company will be back on its feet again,” said Kenneth Mulwa, the company’s board chairman.
 New variety
 Farmers have re-embraced cane farming and are planting a new variety that matures within 12 months of planting.
 Mumias Sugar has been struggling to have a sustainable and profitable strategy by reviewing the way it does business.
 Leaders from the region have also vowed to work together to ensure revival of the company, which serves as the backbone of the region’s economy.
