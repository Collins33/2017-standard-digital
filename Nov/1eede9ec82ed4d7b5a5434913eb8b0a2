 Salgaa stretch which is 14kms long between Salgaa and Sachangwan along the Nakuru-Eldoret highway is one of the deadliest blacks-pot in the country which has claimed hundreds of lives over the years. In one of the horrific incidents, 131 people died at Sachangwan in 2009 when they were burnt to death after an oil tanker went up in flames after an accident.
 
 On November 1, At least five people died in a multiple road crash involving ten vehicles at Migaa on the Salgaa stretch. The incident involved two saloon cars, four transit trucks, one double cabin truck and two canter trucks.
 Despite measures by the government to curb deaths at the notorious stretch including deployment of patrol vehicle along the stretch, it has continued to claim lives with police and the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) blaming the accidents on speeding, lack of discipline by the drivers and free-wheeling.
