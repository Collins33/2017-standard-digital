 The police who had moved to block NASA supporters from accessing Jacaranda grounds in Eastlands where they were to hold a memorial services for victims allegedly felled by police in electioneering period, were seen beating up women mercilessly.
 Near Jacaranda fields, Shalline Kavaya who was taking food to her two year old son at a nearby daycare was ruthlessly beaten up by police, leaving her with extreme pain on the buttocks.

 "I cannot sit down. I tried to tell them that I was only taking food to my baby who was at a daycare across the field but they heard none of that," said Kavaya.
 "I even showed them the food and pointed at the daycare which was visible from where we were, but they kept on hitting me until I ran away," she added.
 Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) condemned the actions saying police had turned such brutality into a normalcy.
 "We have documented over 76 cases of deaths caused by police since August 8, with Nairobi's informal settlements holding the highest number. Police have made it their custom to violate the sanctity of life, they purport to protect," said KNCHR vice chairperson George Morara.
 Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) said they had started investigations into the use of excessive force that left at least two people dead.
