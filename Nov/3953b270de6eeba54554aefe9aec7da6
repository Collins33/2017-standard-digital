The Government Wednesday unveiled a web portal that summarises information on international trade.
 The Information for Trade in Kenya web portal consolidates more than 120 documents and procedures required for the import and export businesses.
 A trader is expected to take a maximum of five minutes to access information from the platform by Kenya Trade Network Agency (KenTrade).
 United States Agency for International Development (USAid) through TradeMark East Africa funded the project to the tune of $498,000 (Sh51.3 million).
