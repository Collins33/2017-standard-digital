&nbsp;A section of Maasai leaders from Kajiado and Narok Counties converged in Narok and passed what they termed the Suswa Declaration - to vote for Raila Odinga - arguing that he will protect their rights to own land. Led by Kajiado Governor David Nkedianye, Narok gubernatorial candidates Patrick ole Ntutu of Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) and ODM&#39;s Joseph Tiambati, the leaders said Raila has demonstrated that he has the interests of the Maa community at heart and they can no longer gamble with their votes. &ldquo;As Maa speaking tribes we have made up our minds about who to vote for on Tuesday next week. And that is Raila Amolo Odinga of the National Super Alliance,&quot; declared Nkedianye. Speaking at the historic Suswa grounds in Narok East constituency Wednesday, where the NASA principals led by Raila addressed one of their final rallies in the region, Nkedianye said their major problem, over the years, has been land rights, which successive government regimes had failed to solve. He said Raila has demonstrated he is cable and willing to resolve the issue once and for all. &quot;We want Mr Odinga to assure us that the land cabinet secretary will be from the Maasai community as a clear demonstration that NASA is willing to help us resolve the land issue and implement the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) report,&quot; he said. A group of Maa elders performed a ritual to bless the NASA leaders and endorse the declaration by the political leaders. Raila was accompanied by his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka, NASA co-principals Musalia Mudavadi and Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto. ALSO READ: Too hot to handle? More judges quit NASA suit
