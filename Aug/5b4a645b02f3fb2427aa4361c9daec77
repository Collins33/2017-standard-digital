During a swearing in ceremony attended by President-elect Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President-elect William Ruto and outgoing Governor Evans Kidero, Sonko said it will not be business as usual as his administration will not tolerate thieves. &ldquo;We are going to seal all loopholes to suffocate cartels stealing our revenue, traders will no longer suffer under people mandated to protect them,&rdquo; said Sonko. &ldquo;My administration is going to work with national government to ensure security, clean water, slum upgrading and sound waste management during our five-year term,&rdquo; he added. Other areas that the governor said he will target include infrastructure development, environment conservation, provision of health facilities as well as education facilities and proper drainage system. President Uhuru Kenyatta assured Sonko of national government support and said he is ready to work with Governor Sonko to create employment to Nairobians.
