Also charged with the theft are the woman&#39;s son, John Mutua, and a mortuary attendant at the Coast General Hospital. Ruth Munee Kisavi, the first wife, had gone to court to challenge Senior Resident Magistrate Edgar Kagoni&#39;s ruling that allowed Mbula to bury Kisangai. Burial arrangements On August 3, 2017, Kagoni ruled that Mbula proceed to bury her husband at their home in Mbooni but allowed Kisavi to participate in the burial arrangements. But on August 4, 2017, Kisavi filed an application before Senior Principal Magistrate Francis Kyiambia and obtained an order stopping the burial. Kisavi argued that according to Kamba customary law on burial, she was the one entitled to bury her husband because she was his first wife. Kisavi obtained a warrant of arrest against her co-wife on August 16, 2017, for contravening court orders. [Joackim Bwana]&nbsp; ALSO READ: Msando was killed because of elections, says Raila
