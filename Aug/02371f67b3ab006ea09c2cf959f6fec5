Her car was a wreck, &ldquo;said Mr James Okaka. Mrs Ouko, a mother of seven, had for many years since her husband&#39;s murder kept out of the limelight. However, she recently told journalists that she still yearned to know who killed her husband and why. In an interview with this writer in 2007, Mrs&nbsp; Ouko spoke of the pain of losing her husband, who was killed on February 12, 1990. &quot;I just don&#39;t know why they killed Bob in such a brutal manner,&quot; she told The Standard then. Dr Ouko&#39;s charred body was found under a guava tree at the foot of Got Alila, some 2.8km from his Koru home two days after he was reported missing. Mrs Ouko was a key witness during the investigations and commissions of inquiry formed by the government to try to identify the killers of her husband. In 1990, she testified to the commission appointed by then President Daniel arap Moi and chaired by then Chief Justice Evan Gicheru and again in 2003 during a parliamentary committee chaired by former Kisumu Town East MP Eric Gor Sungu.
