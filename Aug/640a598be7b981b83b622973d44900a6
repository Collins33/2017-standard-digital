NAIROBI, KENYA: In the run-up to the August 8 elections, you may have received a text asking you to vote for a particular candidate. The&nbsp;message&nbsp;probably addressed you by name, and you may have wondered how the candidate&rsquo;s campaign team got your number or full name. Amos Njeru may help explain how. He is the founder of M-Sema 24/7 Pro, a mobile&nbsp;app&nbsp;that enables users to send information, events or alerts to thousands of subscribers. Amos is pursuing a second degree in health records and information management at Mt Kenya University, but developed the&nbsp;app out of a passion for technology. His first degree was in applied statistics. The inspiration for the&nbsp;app, he says, came after he observed that various groups, government agencies and corporates face challenges relaying information to large numbers of people. &ldquo;While social media platforms have eased the way we communicate, to access the information on these platforms, one must have a smartphone and be connected to the Internet. I was looking to solve this challenge by developing a platform that allows one to receive group&nbsp;messages&nbsp;even if they have a basic phone,&rdquo; Amos, who is 39, says. While other group&nbsp;messaging&nbsp;apps&nbsp;exist, Amos says the uniqueness his platform provides is that it personalises&nbsp;messages, referring to recipients by name. &ldquo;The&nbsp;app&nbsp;also allows a user to form a group with an unlimited number of members, reduces costs of sending texts by 90 per cent and allows for remote registration, where targeted recipients can join a group by sending their details to an&nbsp;app&nbsp;account holder,&rdquo; he says. But it wasn&rsquo;t easy setting up M-Sema. It took Amos three years to develop the&nbsp;app&nbsp;&ndash; including the time spent analysing the problem, coding and piloting it for six months. He developed the&nbsp;app&nbsp;in partnership with Said Suchyar from Pakistan. Inclusive of the costs of labour and hiring consultants, Amos says developing the&nbsp;app&nbsp;cost Sh3 million. Said raised Sh2 million of this amount as part of a shareholding deal where he retains 25 per cent of the company, while Amos raised Sh1 million from his savings, and his family and friends. Amos launched the&nbsp;app&nbsp;in September last year, and has so far got 100 users. They buy the&nbsp;app&nbsp;at a one-off fee of between Sh60,000 and Sh150,000, depending on the level of customisation they want. M-Sema&rsquo;s target group includes county governments, who can use the&nbsp;app&nbsp;to communicate events like the release of bursaries or floating of tenders. &ldquo;The&nbsp;app&nbsp;can be used to reach almost any group &ndash; be it Mama Mbogas, boda boda riders or parents in a school,&rdquo; says Amos. To join the service, he configures a client&rsquo;s phone to enable it to send&nbsp;messages&nbsp;to the preferred group. The client incurs the usual cost of buying SMS bundles from mobile telephony firms, which is relatively inexpensive for large bundles. The&nbsp;app&nbsp;is copyrighted as a literary work by the Kenya Copyright Board, a step Amos relies on to ensure his work isn&rsquo;t copied. He is now hoping to partner with a mobile services firm that can sell phones with the M-Sema&nbsp;app&nbsp;in-built. Amos&rsquo; tips on creating an&nbsp;app 1. Solve a problem: The&nbsp;app&nbsp;must solve a problem. If your idea of developing an&nbsp;app&nbsp;is to&nbsp;make&nbsp;money or get fame without helping people, then you&rsquo;re set to fail.&nbsp; The&nbsp;app&nbsp;should also intuitively serve users so that they are able to appreciate it, and where possible, use it offline. 2. Find a mentor: Work with someone who will help you streamline how the&nbsp;app&nbsp;solves a problem. Network widely with people in the industry. You don&rsquo;t need to have a degree in IT to&nbsp;make&nbsp;an&nbsp;app, so mentors will help fill any gaps in development or guide you on hiring professional developers. 3. Plan on actualising the idea: Have a concrete plan on you how will work on developing the&nbsp;app&nbsp;from scratch to completion. Draft a problem statement and a proposal on how it will work. Preparation is the only way to get a functional&nbsp;app&nbsp;that users can easily navigate and enjoy. 4. Test the&nbsp;app: Test the&nbsp;app&nbsp;on people who don&rsquo;t have a background in IT to&nbsp;make&nbsp;sure it&rsquo;s easy to use and solves the problem it set out to.
