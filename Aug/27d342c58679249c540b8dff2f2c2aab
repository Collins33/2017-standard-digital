The firm will now be a public limited company which, unlike a private limited company, may transfer or sell its shares to members of the public. The company will now be known as Cytonn Investments Management Plc. This means the real estate investment firm will have to be subjected to public scrutiny and will be expected to regularly publish and file financial accounts with the registrar of companies.
