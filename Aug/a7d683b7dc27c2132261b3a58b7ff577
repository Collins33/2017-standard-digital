Reprieve for Kidero as court stops CMA from investigating his accountsKidero argued that CMA&#39;s sudden decision to probe his bank accounts just a few days to the polls was politically instigatedNairobi Governor Evans Kidero got a reprieve after the High Court stopped the Capital Markets Authority from probing his bank accounts. Justice Chacha Mwita ruled that pending the hearing and determination of Kidero&#39;s application, CMA should not proceed with a request to several banks to be furnished with the governor&#39;s accounts details. &quot;The authority is restrained from investigating the petitioner&#39;s bank accounts until the court determines whether it has powers to carry out the probe,&quot; ruled Mr Mwita. Through senior counsel Tom Ojienda, Dr Kidero argued that CMA&#39;s sudden decision to probe his bank accounts just a few days to the polls was politically instigated and meant to portray him as a corrupt leader and give his competitors an advantage. According to Prof Ojienda, CMA tricked the governor into a discussion on possible solutions to the Mumias Sugar Company problems, only for them to use that information to investigate his bank accounts. &quot;Dr Kidero is a victim of a well-schemed script by political opponents who want him harassed and intimidated by different Government agencies to achieve a political outcome and do away with him as Nairobi governor,&quot; said Ojienda.
