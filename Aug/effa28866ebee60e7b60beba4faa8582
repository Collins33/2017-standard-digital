The Kenya shilling has over the last one week held ground and even made slight gains against major world currencies, despite the tensions that followed last Tuesday&rsquo;s polls. It has also withstood the aftermath of the polls, where the Opposition has disputed the election results. According to a Reuters report, it gained slight ground yesterday and traders said they were watching political developments. Banks quoted the shilling at 103.80/90 to the dollar, compared with Friday&rsquo;s close of 103.90/104.00. [Machaira Kamau]
