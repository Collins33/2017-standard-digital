While consumers have been enjoying low flour prices since May when the government opened doors for duty free&nbsp;maize, some&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;have found themselves competing for&nbsp;markets&nbsp;for their grain with cheaper&nbsp;imports. This is as the harvesting season that kicks in has found itself overlapping with the subsidy program. A 90-kilo of&nbsp;maize&nbsp;according to as spot check by the Standard costs Sh3,000. Millers are buying the same amount from international&nbsp;markets&nbsp;at Sh2,300 after a government subsidy of Sh1,300. And though production had fallen due to poor rainfall causing a severe deficit which made sense on why it was necessary to allow&nbsp;cheap&nbsp;maize&nbsp;in the&nbsp;market, it is the extension of this&nbsp;importationperiod to October that is now becoming a cause of worry. Farmers&nbsp;in Kakamega, Bungoma and Kisii have already started harvesting. Those in the food belt regions in Kitale and Eldoret will start harvesting at the end of next month. Farmers&nbsp;fear that millers may have taken advantage of the government subsidy to stockpile which may cause a glut come October when the duty free&nbsp;importation&nbsp;subsidy ends. &ldquo;The subsidy should have gone up to September. Otherwise we will have a&nbsp;huge&nbsp;stock pile and then they will tell us there is no&nbsp;market,&rdquo; says Kipkporir Menjo, the director Kenya&nbsp;Farmers&nbsp;Association.

Last year&nbsp;maize&nbsp;production declined from 42.5 million bags in 2015 to 37.1 million bags in 2016 according from data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) due to poor rainfall. This year, in addition to poor rains, a nationwide army worm invasion will reduce the yield even further. Last month the Government allowed for the&nbsp;importation&nbsp;of 6 million more bags of duty free&nbsp;maize&nbsp;after its food situation report placed the deficit of the grain at 4.5 million bags. However with the&nbsp;importation&nbsp;subsidy coming to an end when harvesting has already started experts say millers and the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) will be in a catch-22 situation. Maize&nbsp;from neighbouring Uganda where they have already harvested is also increasingly finding its way into the country. Data from the Regional Agricultural Trade Intelligence Network shows that this week alone some 3,482 metric tonnes of&nbsp;maize&nbsp;passed through the Busia border into Kenya. Crackdown on cartels &ldquo;Obviously local&nbsp;maize&nbsp;will be very expensive. The question they will be asking themselves is do you buy from&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;at a high price or do you stock pile and use during that period because it is cheaper,&rdquo; says Timothy Njagi, a senior research fellow at the Tegemeo Institute. &ldquo;But this is what happens when governments intervene in the&nbsp;market. The prices are going to be so low I see the Government coming up with another intervention,&rdquo; he observes. Last year,&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;declined to sell to NCPB forcing the State to increase the price of buying&nbsp;maize&nbsp;to Sh3,000 up from Sh2,000. But despite this intervention it is alleged a significant chunk of the&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;sold their&nbsp;maize&nbsp;in neighbouring countries where the prices are better. This has been partly blamed for the current shortage. Nevertheless the board managed to buy only 900,000 bags last season according to its Managing Director Newton Terer. This is a staggering 88 percent short of the preferred eight million bags that are required at Kenya&rsquo;s Strategic Grain Reserve in order to make the country food secure.

I don&rsquo;t decide quantities and the price. We don&rsquo;t do projections,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This is the same thing I was asking today because some&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;in Narok have started to harvest and they were telling us they have some&nbsp;maize&nbsp;that they want to sell to us. It would be good to direct this question to the Ministry,&rdquo; he says. Top officials from the Ministry of Agriculture could not be reached for comment. But when extending the&nbsp;importation&nbsp;period for subsidised&nbsp;maize&nbsp;last month, Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett said he had projected a shortfall during the harvest period. &ldquo;We still have a challenge after the fall armyworm attack. We do not know when our next harvest will be, therefore, we might need to extend the&nbsp;importation&nbsp;period,&rdquo; he told reporters. He promised to crackdown on cartels who may have an intention of hoarding the&nbsp;maize.
