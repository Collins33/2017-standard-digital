The NASA leaders led by ODM National Deputy Director of Elections Bob Njagi accused the ODM candidate David Nkedianye of playing divisive politics. &quot;When NASA leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka went to campaign in Eldoret, they endorsed (Jackson) Mandago, who is the Jubilee candidate. We hope they will respect our decision to back Lenku because we feel he is best placed person to foster harmony among tribes living in the county,&quot; said Njagi.
