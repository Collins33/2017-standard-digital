She argued that the money saved through the salary pay cut will not add any value to lives of Kenyans. &quot;I recently gave my opinion about the salary cut but people are giving me a lot of pressure. I did not make the comment in bad taste,&quot; Wanga said. She argued that any money saved using the salary cut is not likely to be spent in a manner that can benefit Kenyans. According to the legislator, evading the salary cut will enable them offer more financial aid to their electorate who are financially challenged. &quot;A lot of money which remains at the national level elicits many scandals in the National Government. Giving us the desirable salaries will enable our electorate also to benefit from it,&quot; she added. She also renewed calls that the National Supper Alliance legislators should not take oath of office as slated for next week. Wanga said NASA legislators should only be sworn into office after the verdict of the Supreme Court.
