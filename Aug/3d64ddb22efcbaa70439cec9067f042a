Many businesses remained closed in Kisumu county as residents anxiously waited for a &#39;big announcement&#39; by National Super Alliance (NASA) leader Raila Odinga after he rejected the presidential election results last week. Public transport was disrupted while many eateries in the town had not re-opened by yesterday. ALSO READ: Why NASA postponed the big announcement Traders interviewed said they were waiting to hear Raila&#39;s word on &quot;the way forward&quot; before re-opening their businesses. &quot;We don&#39;t know what he will say but the message he passes to Kenyans will determine whether we re-open or not,&quot; said Naomi Kwanga, a fast food kiosk owner. However, most hotels were also closed due to a shortage of vegetables, meat and fish in the town. Most residents also said they walked to work yesterday morning because there were few matatus available.
