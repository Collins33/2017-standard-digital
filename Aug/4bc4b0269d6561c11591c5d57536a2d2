Governor Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o has picked a member of the Siaya County executive as his new county secretary. Former Health Executive Olang&rsquo;o Onudi replaces Ojwang&rsquo; Lusi, who has been holding the position in an acting capacity. This is not the first time Dr Onudi is being picked by Prof Nyong&rsquo;o to head a crucial docket. In 2009, Nyong&rsquo;o, then the minister for Medical Services, picked him to head the Kenya Medical Training College. The appointment ends speculation about the position, which had former Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga, Nyong&rsquo;o&rsquo;s campaign team chairman Patrick Ouya and former campaign manager Nerry Achar as potential candidates. Onudi&rsquo;s appointment will be confirmed if approved by the county assembly once it is sworn in next week. On Thursday, Onudi confirmed that he had accepted the offer and that his first order of business would be an audit of the county&rsquo;s work force. Onudi allayed fears that the new government would immediately start sacking workers employed by the previous regime, saying he would focus on redeployment after completing the audit.
