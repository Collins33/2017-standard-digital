There was chaos at Moi Secondary School, the tallying centre for Nakuru West Constituency after Dr Isoe Ochoki, a parliament candidate on an ODM ticket stormed the centre citing irregularities in tallying. This happened as incumbent MP Samuel Arama on a Jubilee ticket was being declared the winner in the parliamentary race. Supporters of Samuel Arama forcefully chased Ochoki out of the tallying centre. According to results announced by the Presiding Officer, Arama garnered over 29,000 votes compared to Achoki&#39;s 25,000. Ochoki has accused the Returning Officer of interchanging his votes with those of Arama. He said he is headed to courts to seek justice for the people of his area.
