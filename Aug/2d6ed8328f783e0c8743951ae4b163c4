However, the former Mungiki leader ruled out the possibility of him moving to court to challenge the victory adding &quot;doing so would not change results.&quot; &quot;It is my view the electoral outcome was already predetermined to favour my opponent even before the voting kicked off. My moving to court will be a waste of time and resources at least for now,&quot; he said. Instead, Njenga has embarked on preaching peace and unity among Laikipia residences and Kenyans at large. &quot;Disputing results will only bring about disputes among Laikipia residents and may not give a lasting solution,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;My resolve to be an ambassador of peace is informed by the need to unite people for a better tomorrow.&quot; He called on the elected leaders to serve people diligently and bring about development without bias in their respective regions wishing his opponent Nderitu best of luck. &quot;Good leaders are chosen by God and so I believe my turn to lead the people of Laikipia is yet to come, but surely it will,&quot; he said.
