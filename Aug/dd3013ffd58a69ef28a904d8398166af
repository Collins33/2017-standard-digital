Nairobi, Kenya: Only ten people have been killed and dozens injured in various parts of the city in clashes between police and protesters. Nairobi police boss Japheth Koome said the latest two victims died on Sunday. One of them was found dead with a bullet wound in the chest. The second person succumbed to bullet wounds while undergoing treatment. He had been shot and wounded earlier on in Mathare slums. &quot;So far we have ten fatalities. There are few injuries here and there following the skirmishes,&quot; he said. He said most of those killed were criminals. The toll is likely to however increase following reports of another body being discovered in Mathare slums yesterday afternoon. This contradicts earlier statement by Kenya National Human Rights Commission which said 17 people had died in Nairobi by Saturday following post poll violence. Koome termed as unfortunate, the killing of a 10-year-old girl in Mathare on Saturday. He said the child was hit by a stray bullet.
