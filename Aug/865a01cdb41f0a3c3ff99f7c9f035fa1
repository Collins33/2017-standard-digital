Bungoma Governor-elect Wycliffe Wangamati&#39;s swearing in will cost the county Sh8 million. The chairman of the Assumption of Office Committee, Murumba Chiuli, said his team had agreed on the budget to ensure that the ceremony went smoothly. Mr Wangamati is expected to be sworn in on Monday, August 21. Mr Chiuli, who is also the county secretary, said his team had revised the budget from Sh14 million after reviewing logistics. He said the funds were not limited to the swearing-in day alone but other logistics to enable a smooth transition. &quot;We have come up with a budget to help us have a smooth transition. The funds will cater for other issues, including security and other miscellaneous activities,&quot; he said. Chiuli said the committee had met five times, as prescribed in the County Government Act. The committee meetings started on June 27. He said the committee comprised two representatives from each political camp, security chiefs, and a few departmental heads. Chiuli added that the committee was taking stock of assets, liabilities, and human capital to fully brief the incoming team. &quot;We have had fruitful meetings and everything seems to be going smoothly,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
