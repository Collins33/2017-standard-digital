A middle aged man surrendered to the police after allegedly killing his two children in Taita-Taveta County. The deceased identified by police as Gabriel Mutuku, 8 years and Everton Paul Kalii, 5 years were found lying dead with visible injuries inflicted on their necks and their bodies at their rented house at Njukini trading centre in Taveta Sub County. According to the police and neighbours, police said the deceased bodies were covered with a mattress. County Police Commander Fred Ochieng confirmed the arrest and said the suspect is police custody. He said the suspect would be arraigned in court once investigations are complete. The mother to the children, Gladys Muthoni, told the police that she had a domestic quarrel with her husband identified as Charles Mutuku Kalili, 33 on the night of Tuesday. Mr Ochieng said following the domestic brawl, the 28-year old woman escaped to her friend&#39;s house where she spent the night there. He said the woman later went back to the house on Wednesday morning where she found it locked with a latch at the door. The police officer said the woman opened the door and upon her entry she was shocked to find her children dead and in a pool of blood. The bodies were covered with a mattress. Briefing The Standard on the incident on Thursday, the police officer said the suspect later surrendered himself to the Chumvini police patrol base where he was arrested and placed under custody. He said police visited the scene of crime and removed the bodies to the Taveta Sub County hospital mortuary and investigations launched. &nbsp;
