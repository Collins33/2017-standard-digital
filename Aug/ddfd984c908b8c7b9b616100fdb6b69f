Christopher Allen, a freelance reporter and photographer, was embedded with insurgent troops when fighting broke out in Kaya, near South Sudan&#39;s southern border with Uganda. A spokesman for the US embassy told AFP that &quot;an American citizen&quot; had died in the clashes, which also killed 18 others. &quot;Yesterday we confirmed the name and we confirmed the fact that the person was killed. We are not providing any additional information about the situation,&quot; the spokesman added. A spokesman for South Sudan&#39;s armed forces said Allen had not been accredited to cover the conflict by authorities in Juba and it was likely he entered the country through Uganda. A statement from the rebel SPLA-IO forces condemned the fighting that killed Allen as a &quot;monstrous and unnatural act (that) violates international humanitarian law which entitles journalists to all rights and protection during armed conflicts.&quot; Allen had worked for several outlets including Al Jazeera and Vice News and previously covered the conflict in eastern Ukraine. South Sudan&#39;s civil war erupted in December 2013 just two years after it obtained independence from Sudan, when President Salva Kiir accused his former deputy Riek Machar of plotting a coup. Thousands of people have been killed by the violence, which plunged part of the country into famine earlier this year. Some four million have been displaced, according to UN figures.
