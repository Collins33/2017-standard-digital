However, some of them should not be worried if they don&#39;t find their names in the current Government,&quot; said Awiti. The Governor said he had come to the decision after listening to concerns raised by the people of Homa Bay. In the recent General election, Awiti garnered 210,173 votes against his chief rival Oyugi Magwanga who got 189, 060 votes.

In order to correct the anomaly, Awiti said members of&nbsp;his current executive committee must go home to pave ways for other people who can enhance service delivery to the people of Homa Bay.
