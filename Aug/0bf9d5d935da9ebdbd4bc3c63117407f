Three people were Wednesday killed after Al Shabaab militants attacked a passenger bus and a car at Nyongoro area in Witu, Lamu County. The incident happened on Lamu- Garsen highway, police said. Four other people were left with serious bullet injuries. The deceased were in a Toyota Rav4 vehicle which was attacked and burnt by the militants, police said. The bus was on its way from Mombasa to Kipini at about 3.30pm when the incident happened. Witnesses and police said the attackers opened fire from a bush as the bus raced on the road. This forced it to stop, as the officers escorting it confronted the attackers. And when the Rav4, which was few kilometers behind, reached the area it was attacked and burnt. Coast regional police boss Larry Kyeng said they had launched a hunt on the attackers. &quot;They escaped into a bush,&quot; he said.
