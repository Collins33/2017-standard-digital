The National Super Alliance has backed down on its &#39;adopt-a-polling-station&#39; strategy, which called for supporters to remain at polling stations to guard their votes. The coalition&#39;s co-principals have instead told their supporters to vote and move away from the polling centres to avoid confrontation with the police officers manning the stations. Addressing a rally at Kibos grounds in Kisumu yesterday,&nbsp;NASA&nbsp;co-principals Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), and Moses Wetang&#39;ula (Ford-Kenya) said the change of tack was aimed at avoiding playing into Jubilee&#39;s trap. Raila&#39;s running mate, Kalonzo, who addressed the crowd after the presidential candidate, announced: &quot;We have changed the strategy on adopting a polling station.&quot; Kalonzo said the leaders had received intelligence that the Government was planning to use security personnel to provoke their supporters hanging around polling stations to cause chaos, leading to disruption of voting. &quot;We now want our people to vote, leave the stations, and probably move to the nearest market centres, where they will periodically monitor the voter turnout, and then move to the villages to get out the people who have not voted to come out and vote,&quot; said Kalonzo. His sentiments were echoed by Wetang&#39;ula, who said the decision was arrived at after considering that any disruption of voting may hamper maximum voter turnout in&nbsp;NASAstrongholds.

Raila, who was the first to address the crowd, noted that he smelt victory after going around the country and finding that Kenyans were &#39;tired of the Jubilee government&#39;. The&nbsp;NASA&nbsp;team also toured the western region, where Raila told chiefs not to be shaken by sacking threats from President Uhuru Kenyatta. Addressing residents of Malaba in his tour of Busia yesterday, Raila said he would reinstate the sacked chiefs if he wins in next week&#39;s election. Raila&#39;s remarks come just a day after Uhuru said he would punish chiefs from Makueni after the elections for allegedly supporting&nbsp;NASA. The Election Offences Act makes it an offence for public officers to engage in campaigns or other political activities.
