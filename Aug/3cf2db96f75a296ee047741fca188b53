Baby Pendo&rsquo;s parents, Joseph Abanja and his wife Lenser Achieng&#39;, were heartbroken and inconsolable after the doctors informed them that they had lost the baby. &quot;My angel is gone,&quot; Ms Achieng&#39; told Standard Digital, her voice filled with sadness. Her father sobbed as he spoke to reporters outside the hospital.&nbsp; He said they had Baby Pendo after the wife had suffered four miscarriages. &quot;Between the first born and Samantha, my wife lost four pregnancies. We had decided that Samantha was going to be the last,&quot; Abanja said, adding that he did not&nbsp; know how he will settle the Sh 200,000 hospital bill. &quot;We voted and&nbsp; returned&nbsp; home as directed by the Government. Why did&nbsp; the police follow us into the house?,&quot; Abanja posed. His sister, Treeza Uduny said: &quot;The police said&nbsp; they were only beating&nbsp; and shooting criminals. Was the baby a criminal?&rdquo; When the news of the baby&rsquo;s death filtered through the town,&nbsp; sadness engulfed the air and Kisumu residents said the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and acting Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i should take full responsibility for the child&rsquo;s death.

They said no one had been killed or brutalised even as the people here nursed wounds,&rdquo; said equal rights activist Audi Ogada. &quot;I have never seen a Government that defends its officers who brutalise babies. I have never seen a Government that sets its officers on innocent people then calls them criminals,&quot; Ogada added. Abanja said police officers lobbed a teargas canister in their house on Friday night, forcing the couple to run outside with their baby to get fresh air. The officers started beating&nbsp; them with clubs and threatened to shoot them. &quot;Three officers landed on my husband and two others came for me. They hit me on my left arm and hit the baby on the head,&rdquo; Achieng said. Doctors at Aga Khan said&nbsp; the baby had&nbsp; suffered&nbsp; serious head injured&nbsp; after she was hit&nbsp; with&nbsp; a heavy blunt object. &quot;It was a serious head injury and there was internal bleeding,&quot; said Dr Sam Oula, the hospital&#39;s medical director. The baby was put on a life support machine at the ICU, soon after her admission. She never came out of the coma.
