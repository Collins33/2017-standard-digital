The election of Migori County Assembly Speaker was scuttled after youths stormed the chambers and assaulted members. The youths abruptly raided the assembly where stiff competition was being witnessed between lawyer Kerario Marwa and North Kadem MCA Boaz Okoth. The youths who were armed with crude weapons beat up MCAs, took away ballot boxes and papers before breaking them outside the assembly. Esther Onana, nominated under People With Disability (PWD) category, fainted during the scuffle and was rushed to hospital. Many MCAs sought safety in nearby assembly offices, as sergeant-at-arms seized the maces from the house. The rowdy youths invaded the house during the second round of counting in which Kerario had 31 votes - the majority needed out of 56 members who voted. It was alleged that the youths were targeting 17 nominated members whom they accused of giving Kerario the win. Mr Okoth did not participate in the swearing-in of MCAs to enable him contest the assembly speaker seat. During the first round, former Awendo MP Jared Kopiyo withdrew from the race. In the first round, Kerario had 25 votes followed by Okoth&#39;s 21 votes. Other contenders were Edward Obuya Acholla with 8 votes, Enos Nyawata (1) and Evans Achar (1). The rest of the contenders Okula Jack, Dickson Ogolla Ogolla, Naomi Mongera, Philip Makabong&#39;o and Charles Midenga never got any vote.
