Drama ensued at City Hall, Nairobi on Wednesday after Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe stormed county offices and demanded that staff remove portrait of former Governor Evans Kidero that was hanging on one of the walls. An angry Igathe shouted at the people working asking them whether they knew who the newly elected Nairobi Governor is. He noted that by not putting Sonko&rsquo;s portrait on the wall was lack of respect to the Constitution ALSO READ: Sonko now facing harsh reality of governing Nairobi city &ldquo;You guys don&rsquo;t know who is our governor now?&nbsp; You guys have not changed to understand that some people voted and new people came in? You mean in the whole country you are the only people who don&rsquo;t know the governor is Mike Mbuvi Sonko,&rdquo; Igathe asked. Igathe ordered the workers to go through the whole building to ensure that they remove all Kidero potraits and replace them with sonko&rsquo;s. Governor Sonko was sworn in on Monday and listed access to water, better healthcare, proper sewage systems, reliable water supply, and well-maintained roads as some of his priorities. &ldquo;This important day is not historic because of the victory we celebrate today. Today is historic because there is finally hope for the people of Nairobi. &ldquo;I therefore stand before you today to declare that the old Nairobi has finally come to an end. Today we join our hands to embark on a journey to fix a city that has badly been broken down, to a cleaner, greener, healthier and wealthier city,&rdquo; Sonko noted.
