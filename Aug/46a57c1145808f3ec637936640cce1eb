Man kills cousin in polls rowThe two residents have been reading from different scripts since the&nbsp;campaigns startedAn argument between two relatives on who between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga should be elected ended tragically when one of them hacked the other to death. Dennis Luke, a supporter of Raila, the National Super Alliance presidential candidate, was, according to witnesses, killed by a cousin who supports President Kenyatta, the&nbsp;Jubilee Party candidate. The two residents of Shirumba village, Ikolomani sub-county, have been reading from different scripts since the&nbsp;campaigns started. &quot;Elders advised them to support candidates of their choice but maintain peace since they were brothers, but they did not heed the advice,&quot; said Jacob Amukoye. David Ilamwoya,&nbsp;a relative, said the victim came home drunk and armed with a panga and started threatening people. &quot;He (Luke) attacked his cousin, who snatched the panga from him and used it to defend himself. Luke has been threatening to kill family members who are against his preferred candidate,&quot; Mr Ilamwoya said. On realising that he had killed his cousin, the man took off but was arrested by the police in Malinya village. ALSO READ: MPs in final campaigns for Uhuru
