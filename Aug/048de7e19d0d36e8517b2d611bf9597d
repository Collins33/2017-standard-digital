Several members of Parliament toured Kajiado on Tuesday to drum up support for President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election. The campaign caravan, dubbed Uhuruto Express, went around Kajado North sub-county, where leaders urged residents to come out in large numbers during the election and vote for Uhuru. The MPs held rallies in Ongata Rongai, Kiserian, Matasia, Ngong, and Bulbul towns. The leaders, under the campaign dubbed 100 per cent turnout, are out to ensure a high voter turnout next week. The leaders did not advocate the &#39;six-piece&#39; voting pattern but rather focused on campaigning for Uhuru&#39;s re-election. The leaders banked on the Government&#39;s development record, saying Jubilee had delivered on its promises.&quot;We are here to request you to re-elect President Uhuru Kenyatta. Following his development record, he has performed well and I am sure he will continue performing in his second term,&quot; said Othaya MP Mary Wambui. Nominated MP Isaac Mwaura urged Kenyans not to sell their votes. Kajiado North MP Joseph Manje, who hosted the lawmakers, called on residents to maintain peace during and after the elections.
