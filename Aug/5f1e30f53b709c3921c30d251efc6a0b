&nbsp; A boda boda rider has dismissed DNA results showing that he is the father of a child he is accused of siring after defiling a schoolgirl. Michael Akhonya alias Babu is alleged to have defiled the 17-year-old at Emukaba village, Kakamega, in 2013. Akhonya told the court Thursday that samples taken from him were reported to have been spoilt before the tests were conducted. &quot;I was taken to Kakamega County General Hospital where samples of blood from me, the mother, and the child were taken. I was later told that the samples were spoilt before being examined, raising the question whose samples were taken,&quot; the accused claimed. Akhonya said he was asked to report to Kakamega Police Station two days later and he was taken to Kisumu for further examination. &quot;I was taken to Kisumu where a doctor was called. He forced me to open my mouth without any reason after which a machine was put and all this time no explanation was given. I was only told later they were taking samples of saliva for examination,&quot; he said. The girl, a Form Three student, on July 11, 2014 told the court that Akhonya forced her into his house on her way from school after he threatened to stab her with a knife. &quot;I was late from school since there was a harambee. On my way home, I met the accused who told me to comply with his demands to have sex or he stabs me with a knife,&quot; said the girl. According to police officer Cleophas Koech, school uniform and books were recovered from the accused&#39;s house. Koech said: &quot;On August 14, 2014, blood samples were taken from the accused, the newborn, and the victim. The results show that the chances the accused is the father are at 99.99 per cent,&quot; he said. Akhonya is facing an alternative charge of unlawfully committing indecent acts with a minor. Senior Resident Magistrate Bernard Khapoya set the judgment for August 28. [email&#160;protected]
