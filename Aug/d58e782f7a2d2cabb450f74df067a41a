In a meeting with outgoing county executive committee members and chief officers, Mr Mwaisaka warned that workers who fail to adhere to the new rules and regulations would face disciplinary action. &quot;We want to move away from the past where staff used to dress poorly. We have introduced the new dress code to ensure decorum in the public service. Cheap suits and ties &quot;There will be no excuse for not being smart while on duty. There are cheap suits and ties for workers who might not have them,&quot; said the former district commissioner. Mwaisaka also said the new administration would not tolerate lateness and truancy among the county staff. &quot;It will not be business as usual for county staff who report to work late as they will be disciplined.&quot; County workers and local residents have received the directive on the new dress code with mixed feelings.

A cross section of the workers said the new dress code would not work. &quot;We are not opposed to the new law. The new administration should know that suits are expensive and unaffordable to the junior staff who earn meager salaries,&quot; one of them said. &quot;We don&#39;t expect field officers and engineers to put on suits as they are always in the field inspecting development projects. Some of us deal with machines and the new dress code will not work,&quot; another one said.&nbsp;
