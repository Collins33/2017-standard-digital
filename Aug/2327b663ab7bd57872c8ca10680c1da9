A Coast politician&rsquo;s wife, two children, mother and brother were among ten close relatives who died when a boat capsized in the Indian Ocean. Shekue Kahale Mwanati, who contested the Lamu East parliamentary seat on an ODM ticket, also narrowly escaped death in the tragedy on Sunday. He was helped from the rough waters on Monday at 10am. The captain of the boat, Mohammed Shamtei, also died in the accident. The vessel was sailing from Faza to Lamu island and capsized in rough weather as it entered Mkanda Straits off the Lamu mainland. The ODM politician and his relatives were travelling from Kizingitini to Lamu Island. It is around this area where two months ago, another boat accident occurred, leaving about a dozen people,&nbsp;mostly women, dead. MV Samaki, the latest boat to capsize, was making its way from Kizingitini to Lamu and was last seen in Mtangawanda. Lamu Kenya Maritime Authority official Rajab Kibana said they spent the better part of Monday combing the area in search of survivors. He told Lamu residents to stop spreading rumours about&nbsp; the accident. Elsewhere, President Uhuru Kenyatta said he was saddened by the loss of lives in the&nbsp;boat tragedy and a road crash in Meru. The Meru accident killed eight people, including the mother of former student leader and Jubilee Party activist Irene Kendi. The accident occurred on Saturday when a matatu travelling from Maua to Chuka collided head-on with a lorry. Six people were taken to Meru Referral and Teaching Hospital. President Kenyatta said it was unfortunate that the country had lost patriotic and hard-working Kenyans who were ready to continue with nation building after the conclusion of this year&rsquo;s general election. The President condoled with families of the victims, and wished all those injured and admitted to hospitals quick recovery.
