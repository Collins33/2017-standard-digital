Acquisition of the Third Identifier, NTSA said, was part of the Traffic Regulation&nbsp;Plate&nbsp;Rules gazetted in April 2016. Director General Francis Meja said the stickers were meant to increase the authority&#39;s vigilance on the road, which will not necessarily require the presence of traffic officers. Additionally, the stickers will provide a sense of security for vehicle owners as they will be fitted with chips to enable tracking. Mr Meja said from next month, on completion of the inspection process,&nbsp;motorists&nbsp;will be issued with the stickers that will also serve as the official NTSA Motor Vehicle Inspection stickers, which can be read electronically.&nbsp; Motorists&nbsp;will be required to display the stickers on their windscreens at all times. The stickers have a 10-year lifespan.&nbsp;
