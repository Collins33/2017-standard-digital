Boni Khalwale is a bullfighter literally and just like a bull, does not give up easily &mdash; sometimes even when the chips, nay votes, are down. Well, the bullfighter wanted to be the Kakamega Governor after representing the county in the Senate from 2013. But he fell short, and the incumbent Wycliffe Oparanya has retained his seat, but Khalwale is not taking that lying down. He has not only refused to concede defeat, but has called on the police to investigate claims that electoral officials were bribed to rig elections in favour of governor Oparanya. Addressing journalists at a Kakamega hotel, Dr Khalwale said he has made a formal complaint about one of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) officials whom he claims received a bribe from a senior county officer to rig the elections. He said there was sufficient evidence showing how money was deposited in the official&#39;s bank account while the tallying process was underway at Kakamega School. &quot;We call upon investigative agencies to visit the bank and see for themselves how the money was transferred,&rdquo; he said but did not divulge the exact amount paid to the official.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Kabogo: I am ready to work with Waititu
