A 33-year-old woman in West Pokot County has lost her unborn baby after braving long queues to cast her ballot at Kuwit Polling Centre. This was after voters ignored her pleas for help after she began experiencing labour pains while on the queue. &ldquo;After the mother cast her vote, she was taken to the nearby health facility where her unborn baby was declared dead,&rdquo; said Kapchok Ward MCA Peter Lokor. At Konyau Mixed Secondary School of Kapchok Ward in the same county, another woman who identified herself as Mama Cheyech has named her baby Chepkura, meaning elections. The woman gave birth after queuing for more than three hours.&nbsp;
