 In his twitter handle lawyer Apollo Mboya said that the president had violated section 19 of the NCIC ACT which states '' Term of office of the Chairperson and the commissioners shall hold office for a term of three years and shall be eligible for re-appointment for one further term of three years.''
 The chair of the commission have been on the spot on playing hisÂ  role in tackling hate speech cases that have been characterised with political players cutting across the political divide with most of the cases lying in court awaiting determination.
 Hate speech cases have also been on the rise on social media with the commission on July having flagged out a total of 176 social media accounts while 27 cases were under prosecution across the various courts in the country.
 With some of the groups like Group Kenya, NASA politics and jubilee party supporters among others that were adversely mentioned, they are still operational even after Kenyans have cast the ballot.
