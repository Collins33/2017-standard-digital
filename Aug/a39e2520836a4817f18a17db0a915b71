In Summary Nakumatt Supermarket has complied with the&nbsp;ban&nbsp;effected in February this year Lobby groups including Kenya Association of Manufacturers want State to dismiss the ban NAIROBI, KENYA: Kenyans are&nbsp;yet&nbsp;to comply with the&nbsp;plastics&nbsp;ban&nbsp;imposed by the government with less than a week to the August 28 deadline. This is despite the existence of a court case involving Fredrick Njenga and Stephen Mwangi who claim the&nbsp;ban, issued through a legal notice earlier this year, did not comply with the law. The Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) has also pleaded with President Uhuru Kenyatta to dismiss the&nbsp;ban&nbsp;saying it does not augur well economically. Local supermarkets are still providing over the counter paper bags for use by their clients albeit there are those have complied with the order. Tuskey&#39;s Supermarket outlets are still packaging goods using the polythene papers and only time will tell whether they will adopt the new recommended measures. A worker at one of its CBD branches expressed hopes that the court case would be ruled in favour of the petitioner so as not to interrupt operations. &quot;We are&nbsp;yet&nbsp;to adjust because there is a court case pending but we hope that the courts rule in our favour,&quot; said Anthony Kiratu (not real name). At the east matt supermarket, hundreds had yesterday flocked for their daily shopping but it too had not complied with the&nbsp;ban. Bread, milk, fresh produce, meat cereal, cutlery and even water was still packed using white polythene papers. Oblivious, the customers seemed not bothered by the numerous bags they carried out of the establishment which would eventually end up polluting the environment. The situation is replicated across other small scale supermarkets. On the flipside, Nakumatt Supermarket has complied with the&nbsp;ban&nbsp;effected in February this year. Customers, after purchasing goods, are given the alternative to either purchase an environmental friendly bag or sort themselves out. &quot;I support the&nbsp;ban&nbsp;because this way p eople will be forced to seek alternatives such as baskets and this will drive up the economy,&quot; said a supervisor who sought anonymity. Back to the streets, the situation has not changed as thousands still use the&nbsp;plastic&nbsp;bags to carry goods from the market, shops or even store food products such as Unga at home. Christine Mutheu, a trader operating from the Wakulima market, fears that the&nbsp;ban&nbsp;will mean losses for her business. She says that the income she used to get from selling polythene bags alongside her vegetables will dwindle. &quot;I will have to tell my customers to start carrying small sacks or sisal bags to carry their foodstuffs.Sh2 million is too hefty a penalty for me to bear,&quot; she said. Mary Nyambura, a kiosk owner, is of a similar opinion. She is however urging NEMA to give Kenyans more time to adjust to the&nbsp;ban. Environment Cabinet Secretary, Judi Wakhungu earlier this year announced a&nbsp;ban&nbsp;on the use of&nbsp;plastic&nbsp;paper bags. The&nbsp;ban&nbsp;applies to both individuals and manufacturers. Anyone found using the bags is liable to a fine of no less than Sh2 million or a one year jail term. She urged the public to use alternatives such as baskets or bags made from environmental material. This is not the first time Kenya has attempted to&nbsp;ban&nbsp;the use of&nbsp;plastic&nbsp;bags. Similar attempts were made in 2007 and 2011, both unsuccessfully.
