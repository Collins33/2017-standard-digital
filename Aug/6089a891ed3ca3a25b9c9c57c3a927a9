A policeman was arrested after he shot&nbsp;a politician in an altercation outside a bar in Limuru Town. William Kimani Mwangi, 32 was shot dead&nbsp;inside his car as he planned to drive away. Limuru DCI boss Mwenda Itaeba said they are&nbsp;holding the policeman over the shooting incident and he would be charged once&nbsp;investigations are complete. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what happened. The deceased&nbsp;did not warrant to be shot that way and so far we have a suspect in custody,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Itaeba. Witnesses said Mwangi, a building and construction engineer, was shot at close range moments after he had left Club&nbsp;U-Turn at about 3.50 am. He had been in the club with other revelers until late&nbsp;when he left for his home. He had an altercation with a&nbsp;police officer in the club, which left the officer with a face injury. It is alleged the officer was hit with abottle on the face before bouncers on duty intervened and took the policeman outside. It is however not clear what prompted the&nbsp;confrontation amid claims the accused officer had demanded to share a table where&nbsp;Mwangi and other revelers were in vain. As some patrons left the club, they spotted the&nbsp;officer on the corridors there, which made them suspect he was out to revenge. Mwangi left minutes and walked to his car&nbsp;before he ignited it ready to leave. It was at that point that a gunman shot him twice in the head killing him on the spot. Police who were called to the scene said they&nbsp;found the lifeless body of the politician on the steering with the engine still&nbsp;running. &nbsp;It was&nbsp;after brief interrogations on witnesses that a police officer accused of being&nbsp;behind the incident was arrested. Itaeba said they had confiscated a pistol&nbsp;from the officer and collected spent cartridges from the scene of the crime to&nbsp;help in the probe. Mwangi lost Jubilee&nbsp;party primaries for the Lari Kirenga Ward in Limuru.
