Vihiga governor-elect Wilbur Ottichilo has assured contractors and suppliers who did business with the previous administration they will be paid their dues. Mr Ottichilo said it was unfortunate some of them had not been paid since 2014 for their services. He said the move would be in line with his manifesto that is anchored on transparency, accountability and honesty. “We are going to conduct an extensive audit of all the county assets and records to determine what we are inheriting.”
