Gunmen believed to be Al Shabaab militia hijacked three vehicles in an attack along Lafey-Omar Jillow Road in Mandera County. Regional coordinator Mohamud Saleh said targeted vehicles were for civilians, adding that they believe the attackers who were armed were Al Shabaab terrorists who may have crossed from Somalia. Saleh said no injuries were reported in the Monday afternoon incident and a team of security agents had been sent to the area to pursue the gang that is suspected to have crossed to Somalia with the four wheel drive cars. &ldquo;Public service vehicles had passed through the same route earlier on. We don&rsquo;t know why they targeted the private cars,&rdquo; he said. Similar attacks have been witnessed in the area recently, last week terrorists hijacked a vehicle belonging to a politician with its party colours and escaped with it.
