Ms Gesare&#39;s husband, Simon Kombo, was away when the killing occurred. Mr Makori is said to have approached his mother as she cut grass on a farm and slashed her on the hands, head and legs. Area chief Naftal Okangi said the man had leased a small portion of his land to his mother, who had then opted to plant napier grass on the entire parcel of land. &ldquo;The assailant has not been on good terms with local administrators after he once attempted a similar attack on young girl in the village. He seemed to have mental problems,&rdquo; said Mr Okangi. Police officers from Keroka Police Station took the bodies to a private morgue. [Eric Abuga]&nbsp;
