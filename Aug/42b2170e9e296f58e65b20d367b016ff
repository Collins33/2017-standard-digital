&nbsp; NASA leader Raila Odinga joins children in octopus ride at the fun zone NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga joined youths and children on Sunday at The Hub, a recreational facility in Nairobi&rsquo;s Karen estate for fun and relaxation. The NASA leader joined children in octopus ride at the fun zone, attracting attention of many onlookers who kept on shouting &ldquo;baba&rdquo; as he was riding high and higher. This comes after a busy week and campaign schedule, as he was attending several political rallies daily&nbsp;before concluding campaigns yesterday. Some Kenyans have interpreted Raila&rsquo;s move as an attempt to prove&nbsp;that he cares about the youth by taking part in the activities. Raila was following the IEBC requirement that campaigns must end 48 hours to elections to allow voters decide on whom to choose.
