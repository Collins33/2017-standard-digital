Facebook on Monday said that pages that make a habit of linking to bogus news stories will no longer be able to advertise at the world&#39;s leading online social network. The move is the latest shot fired by Facebook in its war against &#39;fake news&#39; used to deceive instead of enlighten.

Concerns have been raised since then about hoaxes and misinformation affecting elections in Europe this year, with investigations showing how &quot;click farms&quot; generate revenue from online advertising using made-up news stories. &quot;We&#39;ve found instances of Pages using Facebook ads to build their audiences in order to distribute false news more broadly,&quot; Lyons and Shukla said.

Google earlier this year added a fact-checking tag to search results globally, its latest initiative to help curb the spread of misinformation and &quot;fake news.&quot; The new tags, to be used in all languages for users worldwide, use third-party fact-checkers to indicate whether news items are true, false or somewhere in-between. The feature debuted about the same time Facebook added a new tool in news feeds to help users determine whether shared stories are real or bogus.
