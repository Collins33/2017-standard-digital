Motorcycles, four-wheel-drives mobilised for Aug 8 pollsElection commission officials from six counties in the North Rift region say they have concluded logistics for next week&#39;s General Election. Their assurance comes amid a number of challenges being faced in Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu and Nandi areas. But the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) election managers say everything is in place, including security patrols, voter sensitisation and procurement of four-wheel-drive vehicles to ensure that all regions are accessible. &quot;Training for Returning Officers (ROs) at constituency level has been concluded,&quot; said Jacktone Nyonje, the IEBC elections manager in Uasin Gishu County. Mr Nyonje said the major challenge was heavy rains currently being experienced in the region and fears of insecurity in bandit-prone areas. &quot;We will need security escorts in some regions of the county such as Turkana West, East and South,&quot; said George Oyugi, the elections manager in Turkana County. Mr Oyugi said there might be need for a standby helicopter to follow nomadic communities to ensure that they vote.

In Elgeyo Marakwet County, IEBC has provided motorbikes to access remote polling centres. Security has also been boosted in bandit-prone areas. &quot;Patrols have been enhanced, especially along the borders of Baringo and West Pokot, to curb any attacks. We will have enough security on the elections day,&quot; said Moses Sunkuli, the county election manager.
