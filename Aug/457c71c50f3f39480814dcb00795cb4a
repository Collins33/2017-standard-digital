Eric Muchangi is on his way to becoming the first member of Akorino church to be elected to Parliament.&nbsp;He lost to Cecily Mbarire in 2013 electionsThe Holy Litany God Healing Church, commonly known as Akorino, is celebrating the victory of one of its own in the elections. Eric Muchangi Njiru, popularly known as &quot;Karemba&quot;, because of his signature white headgear, is well on his way to becoming the first member of the church to be elected to Parliament. According to provisional results, Mr Muchangi commands a massive lead in the race for Runyenjes constituency MP with 57,007 votes. His main competitor, John Njiru Kathangu trails him with a distant 4,664 votes. The other candidates, John Ndigwa had 2,726 votes, Clement Njeru 1,612 votes and Joyce Mukami 490 votes. This was Muchangi&#39;s second bid after an unsuccessful attempt in 2013 when he vied on an Alliance Party of Kenya (APK) ticket and lost to MP Cecily Mbarire. Ms Mbarire did not defend her seat after losing Jubilee primaries for the governor&#39;s seat to Governor Martin Wambora. She has been slotted for nomination by Jubilee Party. Muchangi, who vied on a Jubilee ticket, enjoys massive support in the constituency, especially from the Akorino community .

Former Kinangop MP Mary Wanjiru, who also wore white headgear in Parliament, was thought by many to be an Akorino. But according to Rev Rutere, there has never been an Akorino MP in Kenya.
