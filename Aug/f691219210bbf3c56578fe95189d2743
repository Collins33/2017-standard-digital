There was drama at a Nairobi shopping mall when about 10 men in three tinted four wheel drive vehicles arrived at the mall. Their&nbsp;mission is not known.&nbsp; This prompted fears and concern from businessman Jimmy Wanjigi who was present. His security alleged that the mysterious men may have been out to abduct Wanjigi. The cars drove to ABC Place Shopping Mall Sunday night and parked near Wanjigi&rsquo;s car. When guards on duty inquired about their mission, the mystery men refused to respond. Witnesses said two of the cars drove off, leaving one. The guards took photos of the cars. A few minutes later, Wanjigi walked to where the car was parked with the windows rolled up. In the company of his security, Wanjigi demanded to know their mission. This again prompted the occupants to leave the place without uttering a word, a witness said. Wanjigi told the guards that he feared the group may have wanted to harm or abduct him.&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what their mission was but the boss said they may have been out to harm or take him away by force,&rdquo; said a guard there. Wanjigi left a&nbsp;few minutes later. He has business interests at the mall. ALSO READ: Police finally visit vandalized NASA tallying centre The guards said they would report the matter to Police.
