Tanzania&#39;s main human rights group on Thursday criticised the government for its &quot;harassment&quot; of opposition lawmakers, three of whom have been arrested over the past week. In a statement, the Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC) said the string of arrests amounted to a &quot;violation of political and civic rights&quot; in a country where multi-party politics is enshrined in the constitution.

It is the sixth time Lissu, a lawyer and deputy head of the main opposition Chadema party, has been arrested this year. In July he was charged with hate speech after calling Magufuli a &quot;dictator&quot;. He was arrested on leaving court after attending a hearing in one of the other cases against him. Three days earlier, Ester Bulaya, another Chadema lawmaker, was arrested in the north of the country before taking part in a meeting outside of her electoral constituency. &quot;What law prohibits that?&quot; asked the LHRC statement. And on Wednesday, another MP called Godbless Lema was arrested for taking seven minutes longer than his allocated time for addressing a rally. The LHRC urged the government to respect the right of all political parties to freely carry out their activities. &quot;Being the member of a different party (than the ruling party) is not a crime.&quot; ALSO READ: DP Ruto meets central, Rift leaders Magufuli, who came to power in 2015 as a corruption-fighting &quot;man of the people&quot;, has been increasingly criticised over his authoritarian leadership style, with a clampdown on the opposition, journalists and artists.
