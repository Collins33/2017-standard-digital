The U.S. State Department&#39;s email service has been restored after an approximately half-day outage, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Friday. State Department officials worldwide stopped receiving emails on the agency&#39;s unclassified system around 2 a.m. EDT (0600 GMT) on Friday, officials said. Service was temporarily restored by the early afternoon, Nauert said. &quot;It has been quite a headache today, our email system has been down,&quot; Nauert said at a news briefing. &quot;It was brought up just a short while ago ... there are some glitches that they&#39;re still working out.&quot; The outage was caused by internal human error and not a cyber-attack, an official said.
