A court was yesterday told how a boda boda operator abducted a high school student on her way home and defiled her. According to the teenager&rsquo;s aunt, the Form Three student at a local school went missing on March 31, 2017 and efforts to look for her at her friends&rsquo; homes bore no fruit. The aunt told the court the accused, Shem Barasa, brought the 19-year-old girl in the morning on his motorcycle but fled immediately. She insisted Mr Barasa had given the girl a coat to cover the uniform to hide her identity as a school girl. &ldquo;I saw the accused bring my niece but he immediately covered his face and sped off,&rdquo; said the aunt. She told the court the student was taken to hospital and found to have been sexually assaulted, after which she recorded a statement at Kakamega Police Station. The victim had earlier told the court she was abducted on her way home when the accused offered to carry her on his motorcycle.
