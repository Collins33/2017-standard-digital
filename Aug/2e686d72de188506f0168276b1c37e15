Unknown people have burnt down an assistant chief&#39;s office and business premises at Homa Bay market. The motive of the arsonists was not immediately clear although unconfirmed reports indicated they could have been part of a mob that was protesting against the outcome of the presidential election. The office of Dancun Odhiambo, assistant Chief of Homa Bay Township sub-location, was torched at 9pm on Saturday. Mr Odhiambo told journalists the fire began during fighting between police and youths who were demonstrating over the results. &quot;I got a phone call from one of the residents that my office had been set ablaze. On arrival, I found the building was already engulfed by fire due to a strong wind,&quot; he said. The administrator lost important documents. More than 300 traders operating around the office also suffered an estimated Sh10 million loss after their premises were burnt down.

It is sad that all has been razed down,&quot; said Nyambega. He said the fire incident at the market was the sixth in six months, and urged the county government to buy a fire-fighting machine.
