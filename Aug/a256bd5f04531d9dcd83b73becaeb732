&nbsp; NAIROBI, KENYA: Kenya&#39;s President Uhuru Kenyatta rebuked newly elected members of parliament on Thursday for resisting modest cuts to their salaries and perks, worth more than Sh1 million ($10,000) a month, and said citizens were angry with extravagance in the government.

The issue is an emotive one in the country, where the minimum wage is equivalent to Sh10000 ($100) a month. A lawmaker who sits on the parliamentary service commission, Gladys Wanga, told Reuters on Wednesday the cuts, which have already taken effect, would turn MPs into &quot;beggars&quot;, and vowed to oppose them when parliament restarts next week. Kenyatta told a televised meeting with headteachers: &quot;I&#39;m greatly disturbed by the remarks we have been hearing from yesterday (Wednesday) of individuals who wish to claim that they should be paid more and they will demand more than what the law provides them. &quot;Even as I wait for the Supreme Court to rule (on the election), if it rules in my favour, I&#39;m saying before you, I swear I shall not sign that law.&quot; The annual bill for paying 700,000 public employees, including elected leaders, stands at Sh627 billion ($6.1 billion), which is equal to half of the government&#39;s revenue. The Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC), which sets wage levels, said last month it would slash salaries of top officials, including the president and lawmakers, to save Sh8.5 billion a year. The cuts include the scrapping of a Sh5 million car grant given to every legislator, removal of certain allowances and a Sh90,000 reduction in basic monthly pay. Kenyans have reacted angrily to lawmakers&#39; demands for the reversal of the cuts. They posted fiery messages on social media, threatening to recall their members of parliament, and forcing at least one MP who had protested the cuts to perform a U-turn on TV and say she would &quot;humbly&quot; accept the SRC&#39;s decision. Many elected representatives lost their seats to newcomers and independents in the Aug. 8 election, and Kenyatta attributed that partly to voters&#39; disenchantment with profligacy. &quot;It is shameful that we are barely a week away and they (legislators) have not recognised the issues that made Kenyans angry,&quot; he said.&nbsp; Meanwhile Orange Democratic Movement has distanced itself from a section of party lawmakers demanding for higher salaries. In a statement, the party said the position taken by the members do not represent its position nor that of the National Super Alliance (NASA) of which it is an affiliate. &ldquo;Our attention is drawn to a statement by some incoming Members of the National Assembly regarding proposals for the rationalization of remuneration of members of Parliament as recommended by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission,&rdquo; said ODM Executive Director Oduor Ongwen. &ldquo;We stand for equity and prudent management of public resources. We cannot therefore promote or be seen to promote wastage, avarice and inequities in the Kenyan society,&rdquo; he added.
