SUMMARY Maid is said to have used her connections with police to have employer locked Police deny locking the employer over delayed salary of Sh 5000 Police say there are no records on the Occurrence Book to show employer was arrested and booked NAIROBI, KENYA: A woman is claimed to have spent the better part of Tuesday in police custody after her house-help organized to have her locked up for delaying her pay. The 24-year old domestic worker, is claimed to have used her connections with the area police to have her employer Milka Njiru in custody until she pays the dues. This is despite the two having put into writing an agreement seen by The Standard that stipulated that Christine will be paid on sixth of every month. However, as narrated by Ms Njiru, Christine demanded for her pay earlier than the date, on July 31 and said she was &#39;no longer interested in working as a maid&#39;. And when she was told she had to wait for pay, she is said to have colluded with the police to have Ms Njiru arrested at her work place. &quot;I did not make a statement. Nothing. I was just put locked up in the crime office. Her date of payment was not due but the police insisted that I give her what she is owed,&quot; she narrated when The Standard caught up with her at her home in Ruai. Area police however denied that Ms Njiru spent the day in their cells. There were also no records on the Occurrence Book to show she was arrested and booked as it is the procedure. &quot;That was a civil case and we saw no need to having it recorded. People come here with claims and we have them sit down and come to an agreement. But we did not lock her up,&quot; said Hamisi Shivasti. The genesis of the feud between the two is said to have started on Sunday evening when the worker&nbsp;failed to return home on time from church showing up at 8pm.
