Chief Justice David Maraga has in the past made it clear that judicial appointments are no longer a favour from the Executive. He was reacting to the impression created by President Uhuru Kenyatta at a rally in Kisii that his appointment as head of the Judiciary was a favour by the Jubilee administration. Mr Maraga has come out again to dismiss attempts by politicians to give directives to judges and other judicial appointees on the way to discharge their duties. The CJ&#39;s firm position is a crucial blow in support of democracy, especially after the 2010 constitution clearly separated the roles of the three arms of Government. Indeed, prior to the promulgation of the Constitution Kenya 2010, the Judiciary was an appendage of the Executive arm of government; jumping at its beck and call. Not any more. The new constitution and reforms initiated by former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga have given the Judiciary independence and power to fend off would-be manipulators. Judges&rsquo; decisions result from interpretation of the law and logical deduction. They are not immune to criticism, but attempts to water down the supremacy of the Judiciary in interpreting the law must be resisted especially now when they are expected to offer the last word on electoral outcomes. &nbsp;They must nevertheless be objective and avoid taking sides in divisive disputes that rock our politics almost endlessly.
