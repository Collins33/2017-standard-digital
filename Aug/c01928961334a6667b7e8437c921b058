Acting Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i has denied reports of police using excessive force to control protests that broke out Saturday night after President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared winner. Matiang&iacute; said the country is calm except some parts of Mathare, Kibera and Kisumu where protests are being held and the police have responded to restore peace. &ldquo;The Government will stop at nothing short of protectingthe lives of Kenyans and their property and [we] warn any person that may have criminal intent that they will face the full force of the law,&rdquo; Matiang&iacute; said during a press briefing in Nairobi. He added that the protests are being fanned by false social media posts and the Government is on high alert and anybody found spreading propaganda on social media will be arrested. &ldquo;There has been an increase in a number of false and inflammatory messages being spread on social media platforms, we have laws that govern against abuse of social media and the Government will not hesitate to take action against culprits,&rdquo; he said. He said demonstrations are allowed by law&nbsp;but they must be peaceful, without posing a threat to life or property. Matiang&#39;&iacute; urged both local and international media to exercise their duty responsibly, to inform accurately without fanning violence.
