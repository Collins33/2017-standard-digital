Christopher Aura, an environmental scientist and the Kisumu director of The Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, said that plastic pollutants in the lake have been having damaging effects on aquatic life as well as on fishing and tourism activities. Mr Aura said the lake has been heavily affected by several pollutants including plastics which have curtailed the movement of fish in the lake. &ldquo;Plastics block water ways and also interferes with the circulation of oxygen in the lake. Fish can easily be chocked as a result of interference in air supply and free movement of water,&rdquo; said Aura. As a result, he said, the breeding characteristics of some fish species have been affected negatively by pollution. In the recent past, several experts including the East African Community raised concerns over the heavy pollution of the lake. Dr Ali Matano, the Executive Secretary of Lake Victoria Basin Commission, called for stringent measures to help address the continued degradation and pollution of the fresh water lake.
