Four people who had been contracted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to oversee elections in Vihiga County have been sacked. Deputy County Returning Officer in Vihiga, Charles Avedi, said the officers were sacked after it was established they were gazetted to be nominated by Amani National Congress party to Vihiga County Assembly. Avedi said Governor Moses Akaranga&#39;s Progressive Party of Kenya (PPK) complained about the officers and the commission had to take action. &quot;We have terminated the contracts of three presiding officers and one clerk after we confirmed they were nominated and gazetted by Amani National Congress,&quot; Avedi. He added, &ldquo;We have communicated to PPK to that effect.&rdquo; The three presiding officers include Catherine Jayo who had been assigned to be in Vihiga Sub County, Ongadi Mulegi who was to oversee elections in Sabatia Sub County and James Aluda for Busali ward. Akhalakwa Makabuti, who had been assigned as a clerk in Hamisi Sub County has also been sacked.

We demand that the mentioned people be terminated with immediate effect since the election will not be free and fair (with their presence),&rdquo; a section of the letter read.
