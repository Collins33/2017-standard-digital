The National Super Alliance (NASA) is not under pressure to name its presidential flag bearer, Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula has said. Wetang&#39;ula said the four principals will not pressurise the committee tasked to come up with the selection process of the flag bearer to wind up its work immediately. He said they still have a lot of time for consultations and will unveil their presidential candidate when the right time comes. &quot;Don&#39;t put any pressure on us to unveil our flag bearer. We know the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission&#39;s (IEBC) timelines, which we will duly comply with,&quot; he said. &quot;The committee is still consulting and when the right time comes, they will give us their conclusion.&quot; He addressed journalists&nbsp;when he visited the family of Kenya&#39;s first independent Education Cabinet Minister Joseph Otiende, who died earlier this week, at Kegoye village in Vihiga County.

The Senate minority leader noted that in 2002, The National Rainbow Coalition unveiled its flag bearer two months to the elections and went on to beat the Kanu government. &quot;Kenyans already know they will vote Jubilee out of government. And NASA is preparing to give the country the best leader. We urge our supporters to be patient. We will not lack a candidate,&quot; he said. Wetang&#39;ula said the four principals are all equal to the task and have shown great leadership, giving them an edge over their competitors. &quot;Anyone of us in NASA is as good as the other. Anyone who thinks he is more special than the other should not be in NASA,&quot; he said. Khalwale said joint nominations will only take place in battle grounds between Jubilee and NASA.
