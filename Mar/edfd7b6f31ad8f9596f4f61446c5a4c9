Governors have now softened their stand on the ongoing re-categorisation of health facilities across the county. Through the Council of Governors (CoG), the county chiefs have said they will allow the exercise, spearheaded by the Medical Practitioners and Dentist Board (MPDB), to proceed after being assured it was not being carried out in bad faith. The CoG had expressed concern that the State was planning to return some health facilities to the national government by upgrading some county hospitals. On Friday, CoG Chief Executive Jacqueline Mogeni wrote to counties saying the medical board, saying, &ldquo;Following extensive consultation and clarification of issues during a consultative meeting, the members present agreed that it is important that the exercise goes on as this will provide valuable information on the current status of health facilities and help all stakeholders to identify areas that need improvement on health sector.&rdquo; Ms Mogeni added; &ldquo;We request the CEO of MPDB to confirm that the exercise is conducted in good faith and will not resist in any facility being downgraded or transferred to the national government.&rdquo; The letter is copied to all governors, PS ministry of health and NHIF managing trustee. Meanwhile, the council has requested the Kenya National Union of Nurses for more time to finalise the negations into signing a CBA, after nurses threatened to go on strike.
