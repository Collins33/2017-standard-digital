Scrapping the Sh13 million earmarked for buying a limousine for new Governor Samuel Wamathai is among the key changes made to the Supplementary Budget presented to the county assembly Tuesday. The Budget and Appropriations Committee proposed that the amount be removed from the estimates alongside Sh82 million that was to be used to buy graders. The budget, which has been a bone of contention between the MCAs and Mr Wamathai, was presented for debate. The changes mainly affect the executive. MCAs resumed sittings after a one-week recess. The county assembly has been on the spot after MCAs refused to pass the budget, attracting the ire of President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga. Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga, while addressing mourners during the burial of former governor Nderitu Gachagua, accused MCAs of trying to blackmail governors. President Kenyatta asked the MCAs to pass the budget and give Wamathai a chance to do his work.

Also affected by the changes is the office of the county secretary after money allocated as legal fees and for training was slashed. However, the committee has increased by Sh2 million the money set aside to take care of travel for the office of the governor. &quot;We would like to see all the portholes on our roads fixed and that is why we propose Sh130 million for this project,&quot; Gituanja said. &nbsp;One of the developments expected to be undertaken by the Lands and Physical Planning Department is refurbishment of houses at Ring Road Estate, an upmarket residential area, that will cost Sh7 million.
