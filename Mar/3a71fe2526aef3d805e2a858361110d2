More than half of the 550 patients who sought treatment at a free medical camp organised by seven rotary groups in Mt Kenya region were found to have a lifestyle disease. Judith Karimi, president of Rotary Club of Kirinyaga, noted that residents had many lifestyle diseases. &quot;Most of the patients had hypertension, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and other ailments that developed over time. And the recent doctors&#39; strike complicated treatment for the patients,&quot; Ms Karimi said.
