 The court is turning to mediators to help deal with a backlog of cases. Resident Judge Alfred Mabeya said the Judiciary would soon start training mediators to kick-start the alternative dispute resolution mechanism. He said the mediators would be drawn from religious and social groups. "Some of the groups that could help ease the backlog of cases include the Catholic Church's Peace and Justice committees," Mabeya said yesterday. "Mediators will help settle cases that should not necessarily come to court," he said. The five local courts have 19,700 pending cases.
