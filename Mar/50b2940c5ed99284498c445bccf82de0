Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said the national and county governments have no power to deregister the doctors&rsquo; trade union. Kalonzo scoffed at threats to reign on the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) terming it as futile and illegal. The former Vice President who spoke on Wednesday during the ongoing Devolution Conference, said the constitution of Kenya 2010 has enshrined in the Bill of Rights, the inalienable rights to belong to a trade union and that can&rsquo;t be taken away. &quot;We have read the papers headlines today that the government wants to deregister the doctors union and sack its members. We want to raise a red flag here that such move is illegal and can&#39;t work. The Bill of Rights is very clear and that can&#39;t be taken away,&quot; he said. Kalonzo criticized the government for failing to offer a solution to the doctors&rsquo; strike now on its 96th day claiming that there has been no goodwill from the state. He hit at both the national and county governments for withdrawing a Sh600 million risk allowance offered to the medics to call off the strike, saying the withdrawal was a sign of ill faith. ALSO READ: Kalonzo says deregistering doctors union is unconstitutional Council of governors chairman Peter Munya said the two levels of government had begun dispatching sack letters to doctors and replacing them with medics, some to be hired from foreign countries. &quot;Letters of dismissals are already being sent and we are seeking to have normal services in hospitals by looking for the services across the continent and even outside Africa,&quot; he added. On Tuesday, President Uhuru Kenyatta and all the 47 governors met at the sidelines of the ongoing Devolution Conference in Naivasha, Nakuru County, to crack the whip on KMPDU union officials and their members whose actions have crippled the health sector.
