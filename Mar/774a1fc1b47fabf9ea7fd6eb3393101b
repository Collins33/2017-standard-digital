Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has announced the opening of a new office in Nairobi. The move, the Chicago-based firm said in a statement on Thursday, marks a significant milestone in its global expansion plan. It comes hot on the heels of the recent granting of category-one status to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA). The firm&rsquo;s sub-Saharan Africa Managing Director Miguel Santos said establishing a firm presence on the continent for Boeing was a no-brainer. &ldquo;The aerospace industry needs to start paying closer attention to Africa because this continent is clearly on the move economically and all the trends are pointing in the right direction for the expansion of the sector. Our job is to be ahead in understanding these emerging trends and opportunities,&rdquo; said Santos.
