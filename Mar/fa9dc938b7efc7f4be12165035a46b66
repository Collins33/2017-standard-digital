PRETORIA: Robbers stole 15 computers containing information on South Africa&#39;s judges and court officials from the administrative offices of the Chief Justice on Saturday, the judiciary said. The office of Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng called the crime a huge setback for the administration of justice and urged police &quot;to do everything in their power to ensure that the culprits are brought to book.&quot; Chief Justice spokesman Nathi Mncube told eNCA television earlier that the judiciary was hoping &quot;nothing serious will occur&quot; due to the computer thefts. The ruling African National Congress (ANC) called the burglary &quot;a direct assault on the sanctity of the institutions we, as South Africans, hold dear as propping up our Constitutional order.&quot;
