Nairobi, Kenya: Electoral commission chairman Wafula Chebukati and six commissioners risk being jailed for stopping the continuous voter registration. Activist Okiya Omtatah has filed a contempt of court case against Mr Chebukati and commissioners Consolata Nkatha, Paul Kurgat, Boya Molu, Abdi Guliye, Roselyne Akombe and Margaret Wanjala for stopping the exercise despite an undertaking that they would continue listing voters until June 10. &quot;It is the commission that gave an undertaking in open court, which was recorded by the judge, that they would carry on with the registration until June 10, being 60 days before the election. They cannot therefore go against their word without being punished,&quot; said Mr Omtatah. He wants an order suspending a gazette notice the agency published stopping the exercise.&nbsp;
