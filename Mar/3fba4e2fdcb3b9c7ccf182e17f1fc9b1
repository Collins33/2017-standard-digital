Candidates eyeing various seats in the August polls on a Jubilee ticket can now sigh with relief. The partyThursday extended nomination application deadline by five days. Jubilee had put tomorrow as the deadline for submission of documents for those seeking positions of governor, senator, MP and MCA. However, Jubilee secretary general Veronica Maina said the party had pushed the deadline to March 10. She said they took the decision because they did not want to lock out members wishing to fly the party&#39;s flag in the coming polls. &quot;Many aspirants pleaded with the secretariat for more time. We have heeded their pleas and extended the deadline,&quot; said Ms Maina. &quot;The long queues at the party headquarters informed the decision.&quot; &quot;I am appealing to our candidates to make use of the extension to get the required documents that include a certificate of good conduct and clearance from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC),&quot; she said. The candidates are also required to show proof that they are registered Jubilee Party members before being declared candidates.
