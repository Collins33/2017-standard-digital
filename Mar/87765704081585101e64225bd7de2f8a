Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale claims he has at least 20 scandals that have rocked the county that he will unleash weekly until August. The senator intends to unseat Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. &quot;The scandals will not be propaganda but actual looting tabulated in the Auditor General&#39;s report. I will issue scandal after scandal to the Kakamega people in weekly doses so they can know what has been happening,&quot; he said. &quot;Oparanya has acquired chopper set to campaign against me but that cannot worry me. Because everyone recalls that Stanley Livondo campaigned against me with a chopper, Raila Odinga and Musalia Mudavadi campaigned for my opponent using a chopper in a re-election to unseat me but I beat them and recently Cyrus Jirongo used a chopper to fight me in the senatorial race and I still floored him,&quot; said the Kakamega senator. Khalwale first vied in 1997 for the Ikolomani parliamentary seat and floored former Cotu Secretary General Joseph Mugalla. Governor Oparanya&#39;s communications head Sumba Juma told The Standard that Khalwale had the right to oversight.

He has the right to a campaign strategy so long as the campaigns don&#39;t go against the Ethics,&quot; he said.
