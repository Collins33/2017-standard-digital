The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) has fined two leaders Sh100,000 each for fighting in public. Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma and his rival Washington Ogaga fought in public during a political rally at Homa Bay County Stadium on November 27 last year. ODM Executive Director Oduor Ong&#39;wen said party youth leader in the county, Kevin Ouma, has been barred from contesting for or holding any political seat or party office. He has been implicated in an incident in which youth allied to some politicians heckled Governor Cyprian Awiti during the memorial service for former Homa Bay Senator Otieno Kajwang&#39; at his Waondo village home on the same day. &quot;The party is committed to taking disciplinary measures to prevent anybody from perpetrating violence ahead of the party primaries,&quot; said Ong&#39;wen. Ong&#39;wen said seven other leaders were reprimanded, including Awiti, Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata, MPs Oyugi Magwanga (Kasipul), Tom Kajwang&#39; (Ruaraka), Woman Rep Gladys Wanga and politicians Enosh Bolo and Jack Nduru. &quot;The above persons be cautioned that their subsequent involvement in any act of disruption or violence shall lead to automatic disqualification from seeking any office in the Party or with the support thereof,&quot; read part of the document.
