&nbsp; Turkish authorities detained more than 2,000 people over the last week for suspected links to militant groups or last year&#39;s failed coup attempt, the interior ministry said on Monday. Turkey, which faces multiple security threats, including the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the Islamic State militant group, has also widened a crackdown on alleged supporters of the July coup attempt. In a statement, the interior ministry said 2,063 people had been detained for questioning in the past week. A total of 999 of those were suspected of links to the autonomy-seeking PKK, which has carried out a three-decade insurgency against the government and is considered a terrorist organisation by the United States, Turkey and Europe. Another 966 were detained for suspected ties to the U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for orchestrating an attempted coup in July. Gulen denies any involvement and has condemned the coup.
