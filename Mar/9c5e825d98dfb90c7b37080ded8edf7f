Leaders of the National Rainbow Coalition (Narc), Chama Cha Uzalendo (CCU), People&#39;s Trust Party (PTP) and Muungano Party met and agreed that they would support Kalonzo Musyoka&#39;s bid for the presidency in NASA. Kalonzo is hopeful of clinching the ticket and facing off with Jubilee&#39;s President Uhuru Kenyatta among other presidential hopefuls in the August polls. Among those who attended the meeting were former Lands Cabinet Secretary Charity Ngilu (Narc), CCU leader Wavinya Ndeti, PTP leader Mutua Katuku and former Muungano Party leader and Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana. According to Mr Katuku, the meeting of party leaders from Ukambani was meant to solidify Kalonzo&#39;s support. Sources inside Wiper indicated that at some point, the party was unhappy with Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama&#39;s loyalty in the National Co-ordinating Committee and was looking for a replacement.
