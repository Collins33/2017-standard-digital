Squatters at the disputed Chepchoina Settlement Scheme in West Pokot staged demonstrations to protest against eviction threats from the local administration. The 200 squatters vowed to resist eviction, and complained that the orders were issued during the planting season when they are preparing their farms ahead of the oncoming rains. Led by Mr James Kaburu, the squatters said they had legitimate allotment letters issued in 1998. However, confusion arose when a new lot of squatters claimed they had also been issued with similar allotment letters.
