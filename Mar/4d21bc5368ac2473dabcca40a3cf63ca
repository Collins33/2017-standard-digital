&nbsp; Tension is high in Samburu North Sub-county after one person was shot dead and two others seriously injured in a banditry attack in Lolei village. The deceased is believed to have been part of the gang who engaged the police in battle during an operation to recover stolen livestock. According to residents, three bandits, one of them armed with a gun, stormed a water point in the village and drove away goats, 15 of which were recovered during the police operation. Efforts to reach County Commissioner Mohammed Birik for comment were futile as he was reported to be leading security operations at the scene of the attack. Friday, area Governor Moses Lenolkulal called on government to pursue the bandits. ALSO READ: World Bank boss Jim Yong Kim calls for action on hunger
