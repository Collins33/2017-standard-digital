Pope Francis has said he is willing to consider ordaining older married men in isolated communities, but has ruled out making priestly celibacy optional to tackle a shortage of clergy. The shortage has prompted calls from some progressives to end the ancient tradition of celibacy for Roman Catholic priests. Such a move would represent revolutionary change for the Catholic Church and would likely face massive resistance. Reformers, however, have long suggested that the Vatican could ordain &quot;viri probati&quot; -- Latin for men of proven character -- who tend to be older, with grown-up families if married. In an interview with Germany&#39;s Die Zeit newspaper, the pope said this option could be considered. &quot;We have to give a thought to whether viri probati are a possibility. We then also need to determine which tasks they could take on, such as in isolated areas, for example,&quot; he was quoted as saying.

But voluntary celibacy is not a solution,&quot; he said. The Catholic Church values celibacy as a virtue that frees priests to devote their lives fully to serve God.
