&nbsp; Kipsigis professionals in Narok have dismissed Chama Cha Mashinani&#39;s forays in the county. The professionals led by Kalenjin Professionals Narok Chapter Chairman Dr Nahashon Lang&#39;at said Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto&#39;s party was bound to fail in its mission to woo the Kipsigis in Narok. Speaking to The Standard in Narok Thursday, Dr Lang&#39;at, who is also an aspiring Member of Parliament for Narok South constituency, asked those rebelling against DP William Ruto to come clean on who their presidential candidate is between Jubilee and opposition NASA. He said it was ironical for the rebels to claim to support President Uhuru Kenyatta and at the same time distance themselves from the DP, who is the President&#39;s running mate in the 2017 polls.
