Some 15 Egyptians have denied being in Kenya illegally. The 15 were arrested by immigration officials who accused them of doing business using fake work permits. Some of the suspects had expired tourist visas and were found with assorted goods including electronics, curtains and kitchenware. They denied the charges and were released on a bond of Sh200, 000 and an alternative cash bail of Sh100, 000. Four of the Egyptians were accused of being in possession of forged special passes. The case will be heard on April 29.
