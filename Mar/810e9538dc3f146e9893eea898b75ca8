The Pentagon said that a U.S. air strike in Afghanistan this week killed an al Qaeda militant who was responsible for the death of two American service members and accused of involvement in a deadly attack on a bus carrying Sri Lanka&#39;s cricket team in 2009. The Pentagon said in a statement the strike took place on March 19 in Paktika province and killed Qari Yasin, &quot;a well-known al (Qaeda) terrorist leader,&quot; who had ties to the Tehreek-e-Taliban, also known as the Pakistan Taliban. &quot;The death of Qari Yasin is evidence that terrorists who defame Islam and deliberately target innocent people will not escape justice,&quot; U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in the statement. It said that Yasin was responsible for a 2008 bombing on a hotel in Islamabad, Pakistan, which killed dozens of people including two American service members. On Sunday, Pakistani security sources and Islamist militants said that a U.S. drone air strike in Afghanistan had killed Yasin, also known as Ustad Aslam. Pakistan&#39;s Counter-Terrorism Department had offered a bounty of 2 million rupees ($19,000) for Yasin, saying he was involved in the 2009 bus attack in the northeastern city of Lahore, allegedly organized by militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.

At least 10 gunmen fired on the bus with rifles, grenades and rockets, wounding six players and a British coach, and killing eight Pakistanis. Since then, Pakistan has been forced to play most of its &quot;home&quot; games in the United Arab Emirates.
