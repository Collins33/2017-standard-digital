Nominated&nbsp;MP&nbsp;Oburu&nbsp;Oginga&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;accused&nbsp;of&nbsp;meddling&nbsp;in the&nbsp;preparations&nbsp;for the&nbsp;Orange&nbsp;Democratic&nbsp;Movement&nbsp;party nominations. Oburu&nbsp;is said to be using the Odinga name to campaign for certain candidates. The Suba Council of Elders claimed&nbsp;Oburu, who is Opposition leader Raila Odinga&#39;s older brother, was perpetrating voter apathy, which could affect Raila&#39;s bid for the presidency. Addressing journalists in Homa Bay town yesterday, the elders expressed dissatisfaction with&nbsp;Oburu&#39;s efforts to endorse Suba&nbsp;MP&nbsp;John Mbadi in the race for the Suba parliamentary seat. The contest for the seat&nbsp;has&nbsp;pitted Mr Mbadi, who is the ODM national chairman, against Raila&#39;s former chief of staff, Caroli Omondi. The other aspirant is Jackline Nyandeje. Last Monday, the&nbsp;nominated&nbsp;MP&nbsp;led a campaign for Mbadi and asked Mr Omondi to drop his bid for the position.

I can negotiate with him to drop his bid,&quot; said&nbsp;Oburu. But yesterday, the elders, led by their chairman Simon Kayako and secretary Jacob Mang&#39;ira, expressed concern about the&nbsp;nominated&nbsp;MP&#39;s utterances. Mr Kayako said&nbsp;Oburu&#39;s words created a perception in the area that he (Oburu) had&nbsp;been&nbsp;sent by Raila. &quot;We are worried that&nbsp;Oburu&nbsp;came here to endorse Mbadi for this seat. Many Suba residents will tend to think that he&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;sent by Raila, who is the political supremo in the region. We do not agree with him,&quot; said Kayako.

It does not matter whether it is Caroli or Mbadi who wins the ODM ticket; the most important thing is that we need neutrality in the&nbsp;nominations,&quot; said Clement Okondo, a council member. The elders told&nbsp;Oburu&nbsp;to stop interfering in Nyanza region politics. &quot;We want&nbsp;Oburu&nbsp;to go and campaign for Raila outside Nyanza region if he wants him to be president. What he is doing is tantamount to spoiling Raila&#39;s support,&quot; said Mr Mang&#39;ira. The elders appealed to the ODM National Elections Board not to award Mbadi a&nbsp;nomination&nbsp;ticket on grounds that he is the&nbsp;party&#39;s national chairman.
