President Uhuru Kenyatta has called for people found guilty of corruption barred from holding public office. &nbsp;In a speech read by Attorney General Githu Muigai during the third edition of the Huduma Ombudsman Public Service Awards in Nairobi&nbsp;yesterday, Uhuru said corruption was killing the Kenyan dream. &quot;Our oversight institutions should lead the way by discharging their mandates without fear of any external interference,&quot; he said.
