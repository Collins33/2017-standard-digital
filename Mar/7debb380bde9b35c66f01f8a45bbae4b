Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa has appealed to Trans Nzoia residents to re-elect incumbent Governor Patrick Khaemba. Wamalwa, who has been a fierce critic of the governor, said he would join the gubernatorial race in 2022. There were reports that the governor had joined ANC, but Khaemba dismissed the claims, maintaining that he wais still in Ford Kenya. The controversial multi-million Kitale Referral Hospital, modern bus terminus, and agricultural projects are some of the development projects the governor is using to market his re-election. &nbsp;Addressing residents of Kapomboi area, Khaemba urged them to give him a second term to enable him to complete the projects his administration has initiated.
