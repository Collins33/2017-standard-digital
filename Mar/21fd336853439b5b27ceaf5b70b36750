Migori Governor Okoth Obado has defended Luo Nyanza governors over claims that they have performed poorly. In an exclusive interview with The Standard, Mr Obado said contrary to popular opinion, he and his counterparts from Kisumu, Siaya and Homa Bay had done well and should be re-elected. He was reacting to corruption allegations against them by their rivals seeking to unseat them. &quot;When they say we have not performed, where is the yardstick? We are the pioneer governors in a region that was neglected in terms of development and infrastructure by the central government, and we have helped the people feel the effects of decentralisation,&quot; he said. Obado insisted that there had been a significant change in the region thanks to the governors, and that it was unfair to judge them based on one term. He said aspirants seeking to unseat him and other governors did not have the people&#39;s interests at heart. &quot;The notion that the seat is synonymous with resources is what has motivated some of the big names to seek the governorship. The position was there in 2013 but some termed it village politics; why the sudden interest?&quot; ALSO READ: Migori seeks investors to grow tourism He further urged the ODM party to conduct fair nominations and asked the losers to support the winners. The four governors had previously asked the party to give them direct tickets.
