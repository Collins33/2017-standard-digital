&nbsp; Rosemary Odinga, the daughter of Opposition leader Raila Odinga, was Tuesday flown to South Africa for further treatment. She had been admitted to the Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi for more than a week. She is expected to undergo surgery at an undisclosed hospital to remove a tumor in her brain, an official said. The family doctor, Oluoch Olunya, a renowned neurosurgeon, accompanied her. Rosemary was admitted to hospital on February 18 after she complained of a headache.
