Interim Jubilee chairman Simon Kamau Gikuru and secretary general Samuel Macharia have been kicked out of office after claims they solicited for bribes from aspirants to accord them special favours during nominations. Nine members ratified the sacking of the two and immediately picked Ms Jane Wanjiru Muiga as the new branch chairman while Mr Joel Irungu has replaced Macharia. Yesterday&#39;s meeting followed a vote of no confidence the officials passed against Gikuru and Macharia a week ago. &nbsp;&quot;We are committed to ensure free, fair and transparent nominations,&quot; Irungu said. However, Macharia insisted he is still the chairman noting the process to remove him had failed.
