The county government needs&nbsp;Sh1.2 billion to rehabilitate street families. There are about 100,000 children out of school who contribute to the high number of street children in the city, according to Governor Evans Kidero. He said a majority are aged between four and 15 years. Speaking at St Mary&rsquo;s Primary School in Karen, Dr Kidero said his administration did not have enough money to rehabilitate street families. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
