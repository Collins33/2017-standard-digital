Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa now wants his PS Patrick Nduati to be held responsible if the Sh62.3 billion Thwake dam project in Ukambani region is not actualised. The CS yesterday told members of the Parliamentary Agriculture Committee that Nduati&nbsp;ignored his opinion and that of the Attorney General and went ahead to award the lucrative dam contract to the second lowest evaluated bidder. He said he took caution to ensure the procurement process was above board and moved further to seek advisory opinions from AG Githu Muigai and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission before awarding the tender to China Gezhouba Construction Group Corporation (CGGC), a decision the PS rejected. &nbsp;On Wednesday, Mr Nduati defended his move to defy his boss, pointing out that CGGC had integrity issues. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
