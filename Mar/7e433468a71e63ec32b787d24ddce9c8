The deputy to Nakuru County Gubernatorial aspirant John Mututho, Ms Maureen Chebet has defected to Governor Kinuthia Mbugua&#39;s camp from what she described as personal differences. Chebet confirmed that personal differences prompted her to switch her allegiances to Mr Mbugua whom she described as a grass root mobiliser who has articulated unmatched development record throughout the county. Without elaborating, Ms Chebet said &quot;My defection to Mbugua&#39;s camp is due to personal differences since we could not agree on a number of issues&quot;. &quot;Although I have not been offered any opposition in my new found home, I will make sure I vigorously campaign for Mbugua until he is re-elected for a second term. Again, I&#39;m elated to be associated with the winning team,&quot; she added. The gubernatorial race has attracted three front runners in the forthcoming Jubilee Party nominations led by incumbent governor Kinuthia Mbugua, former Nakuru Town Member of Parliament Lee Kinyanjui and Mr Mututho himself. Chebet who hailed from Kuresoi North alleged that Mututho had earlier said he could do without the support of Kuresoi North/South electorate on his way to be elected the next governor.

Sources indicated that Mr Mututho had dropped Ms Chebet owing to her educational background. &quot;I&#39;m a teacher by profession and I lawfully graduated to become a teacher,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m going to give him (Mbugua) my total support in all areas that I had covered for Mututho. They include Mau Narok, Kuresoi, Njoro and Molo,&quot; she said. She called on women to go for elective positions in order to get respected in the society and revealed she had joined the winning team ahead of the Jubilee Party nominations.
