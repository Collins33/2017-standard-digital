Police&nbsp;in&nbsp;Nairobi&nbsp;are&nbsp;concerned&nbsp;with the&nbsp;rising&nbsp;use&nbsp;of&nbsp;homemade&nbsp;guns&nbsp;by&nbsp;criminals&nbsp;committing&nbsp;violent&nbsp;crimes. For the last three months,&nbsp;police&nbsp;have recovered at least 10&nbsp;homemade&nbsp;guns&nbsp;capable of firing from suspected robbers in Eastlands, Riruta and Kikuyu areas. Most of the&nbsp;homemade&nbsp;guns&nbsp;were loaded with ammunition ready to be&nbsp;used. Intelligence officers are&nbsp;concerned&nbsp;that&nbsp;criminals&nbsp;have found someone who manufactures the weapons after security agents reduced the influx of illicit&nbsp;guns&nbsp;into the city. A&nbsp;crime&nbsp;report at Kabete&nbsp;police&nbsp;station reveals that on March 21, detectives acting on a tip-off pursued suspects on a motorcycle along Waiyaki Way, through Uthiru roundabout onto Naivasha Road towards Kawagware.&nbsp;Police&nbsp;finally intercepted the motorbike at Kathondeki where two pillion riders jumped off and ran into a nappier grass farm before engaging the&nbsp;police&nbsp;in a shootout. Police&nbsp;shot one suspect dead, while the other escaped, and recovered a&nbsp;homemade&nbsp;gun&nbsp;loaded with three bullets and a red beret. According to a&nbsp;police&nbsp;report, a&nbsp;homemade&nbsp;pistol was also recovered from four suspected robbers in Riruta on March 20.

Police&nbsp;officers on patrol responded to the victim&rsquo;s distress call and shot dead two suspects in their 20s and recovered a&nbsp;homemade&nbsp;pistol with two bullets along with a motorcycle whose registration had been tampered with. On March 19, yet another&nbsp;homemade&nbsp;gun&nbsp;was recovered, following a shootout between&nbsp;police&nbsp;and suspected robbers in Kayole&rsquo;s Soweto slum during which one suspect was shot dead. The second suspect was shot dead in an open field in Saika estate and a&nbsp;homemade&nbsp;pistol with four bullets was recovered from him.

Flying Squad boss Said Kiprono said they are alarmed by the increase in the&nbsp;use&nbsp;of such weapons and are investigating their source. &ldquo;They are very rudimentary but effective weapons being&nbsp;used&nbsp;to&nbsp;commit&nbsp;crimes. &ldquo;We believe they are being made by some welders who might have an idea of how a&nbsp;gun&nbsp;operates,&rdquo; said Kiprono. &ldquo;However, they cannot fire rapidly because they lack the self-eject mechanism for cartridges. It can fire once and&nbsp;criminals&nbsp;use&nbsp;them to facilitate escape when they are confronted by&nbsp;police. We don&rsquo;t think they are being mass produced.&rdquo; Kiprono said they are tracking the source and are confident they will soon get a breakthrough.
