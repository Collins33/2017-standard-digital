Ngulot hill is found 13 kilometres east of Lemek town in the semi-arid southern part of Narok South sub-county. It is on the outskirts of the world famous Masai Mara game reserve. The hill forms a land mark and is about ten kilometres long stretching from Ririk to Tipis. Its most prevalent vegetation is the acacia tree known as Olerai in the local Maasai dialect. Ngulot has a long standing folklore attached to it that has kept locals fascinated by this wonder of nature for years. According to tour guide Joseph Ole Shompisha, in the early 1970&rsquo;s there was an unknown creature that would glow at the top of the hill each night without fail. &ldquo;Locals would speculate that it was a huge python using luminous eggs it had laid to lure its prey but no-one could say for sure what it was. So fascinating was the phenomenon that a local renowned Kipsigis singer sang about the hill asking what the animal that lights it up was,&rdquo; said the 69-year-old. While it is yet to be determined what mystical creature once dwelt upon the hill, the diversity of birds found therein is evident for all to see. The hill is some kind of bird watcher&rsquo;s paradise as it is home to rare bird species which share this space with a variety of snake species. The hill is also home to many indigenous trees and shrubs. Some of these have medicinal value and locals use them to treat common ailments such as coughs, rashes and other diseases.
