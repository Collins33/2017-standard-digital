On&nbsp;December&nbsp;18,&nbsp;2003,&nbsp;Philister&nbsp;Achieng&rsquo;&nbsp;made&nbsp;a&nbsp;promise&nbsp;to&nbsp;her&nbsp;dying&nbsp;husband&nbsp;&ndash; that&nbsp;she&nbsp;will&nbsp;work&nbsp;hard&nbsp;on their&nbsp;farm&nbsp;and&nbsp;ensure&nbsp;their&nbsp;children&nbsp;are&nbsp;taken&nbsp;care&nbsp;of. Her&nbsp;husband, Joseph Arodi, came home complaining of a stomach ache. His condition deteriorated so fast, and as they were looking for a vehicle to take Joseph to hospital, he succumbed. His words however remained etched on&nbsp;Philister&rsquo;s&nbsp;mind. &ldquo;He wanted me to&nbsp;work&nbsp;hard&nbsp;for his&nbsp;children, so I threw myself in the&nbsp;farm&nbsp;and started&nbsp;working,&rdquo;&nbsp;she&nbsp;says. That&nbsp;promise&nbsp;marked&nbsp;her&nbsp;entry into pepper&nbsp;farming. Since&nbsp;her&nbsp;husband&nbsp;died,&nbsp;Philister&nbsp;has been a commercial pepper farmer. This has not only provided&nbsp;her&nbsp;with a means of income, but&nbsp;she&nbsp;regards it as a distraction that gave a cushion when&nbsp;shewas mourning&nbsp;her&nbsp;husband&rsquo;s&nbsp;sudden death.

On a good harvest season,&nbsp;she&nbsp;sells a 50-kilogramme bag for Sh2,000.&nbsp;Her&nbsp;customer base is in Kisumu&rsquo;s Kibuye and Jubilee markets. They buy from&nbsp;her&nbsp;to sell to hotels and local consumers. She&nbsp;says&nbsp;she&nbsp;chose pepper&nbsp;farming, because it seems to flourish in Nyanza.&nbsp;She&nbsp;had previously tried maize, but the harvest was not&nbsp;promising&nbsp;so&nbsp;she&nbsp;abandoned it and directed&nbsp;her&nbsp;energy to pepper&nbsp;farming. However, this year&rsquo;s drought is threatening the&nbsp;promise&nbsp;she&nbsp;made.&nbsp;She&nbsp;says&nbsp;her&nbsp;plants have been shriveling with each passing day. &ldquo;I walk for almost three kilometres daily to get water, but they still dry up because it is too hot,&rdquo;&nbsp;she&nbsp;says. The&nbsp;promise&nbsp;she&nbsp;made&nbsp;her&nbsp;husband&nbsp;remains dear to&nbsp;her.&nbsp;She&nbsp;has now built a nursery in an attempt to grow pepper away from the sun. However, the relentless sun still sneaks into&nbsp;her&nbsp;seedlings and dries them up. &ldquo;I try my best, but it seems this season will ruin everything and leave us with nothing,&rdquo;&nbsp;she&nbsp;says.

The calls started reducing, and now, none of them calls&nbsp;her. &ldquo;Maybe they found another supplier. I hope the rains will come and I will resume&nbsp;farming,&rdquo;&nbsp;she&nbsp;says. Though the farmer is experiencing some challenges like the drought, pepper&nbsp;farming&nbsp;has good prospects. According to Grace Mureithi, an agronismist based in Nairobi, pepper&nbsp;farming&nbsp;is a lucrative business if a farmer gets it right. &quot;There is no doubt pepper&nbsp;farming&nbsp;is a worthwhile business and a good investment, but before one gets into it, there are certain things, such as the market, they need to get right. Once you have a market, you are good to go,&rdquo;&nbsp;she&nbsp;explains. The beauty of pepper&nbsp;farming,&nbsp;she&nbsp;says, is that it is rarely attacked by pests and diseases. Also, it grows very fast and does not have a high failure rate because it is a dry land crop. She&nbsp;explains that there are different varieties of pepper and most mature within three to four months. Though&nbsp;promising, there is a downside to pepper&nbsp;farming,&nbsp;she&nbsp;warns. &ldquo;Because there are a lot of companies that had offered good deals, so many farmers came on board and the market was flooded. There are so many demands the export firms make that many small holder farmers could not meet, so I know farmers in Nakuru who are stuck with their pepper because it has been rejected by exporters,&rdquo; the expert cautions.
