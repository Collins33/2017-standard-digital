A three-year-old child has died and another is fighting for her life after they ate poisonous cassava in Eshirembe village, Butere sub-county. The surviving child, five-year-old Belinda Juma, is admitted at St Mary&#39;s Mission Hospital in Mumias. Florence Ameyo started vomiting moments after eating the meal and died before arriving at the hospital. &quot;We took both to a nearby health centre but we were referred to St Mary&#39;s. Unfortunately my daughter died before we could get there,&quot; said their mother, Pauline Mirikau. Ms Mirikau said she borrowed the cassava from a neighbour but after cooking it, was reluctant to serve it because it tasted very bitter. &quot;I went to a nearby shopping centre to buy bread only to find the children feasting on the cassava. Later, they began vomiting and complaining of stomach aches,&quot; she told journalists.

Area chief Aggrey Maina said investigations were ongoing to establish whether the cassava was poisoned before being cooked. &quot;It is a shocking incident. We encourage people to seek advice from agriculture extension officers on where to get certified cassava seed to avert similar tragedies,&quot; he said. Elsewhere, a man was burnt beyond recognition in his house in Kakoi village, Malava constituency.
