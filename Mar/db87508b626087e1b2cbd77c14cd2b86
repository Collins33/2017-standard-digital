Green building champions are meeting in Nairobi to discuss the challenges hampering the adoption of sustainable building technology. The three-day summit started yesterday at the United Nations Offices in Gigiri under the auspices of the Africa Green Building. It brings together both local and international green technology experts and and suppliers. The theme for the forum, which is being hosted by the Kenya Green Building Society, is &ldquo;Financing Sustainable Development Goals&rdquo;. The key speaker is Jerry Yudelson, an engineer and expert in LEED green building rating systems. &ldquo;AGBS will feature three days of inspiring speakers, invaluable networking opportunities, occasions to showcase green products and services as well as training on Green Star Communities,&rdquo; said Elizabeth Chege, (Kenya Green Building Society) KGBS chairperson. During the meeting, KGBS will also host the World Green Building Council&rsquo;s Africa Regional Network meeting for the first time in its history. This, according to organisers, will be an opportunity to unlock finances for Africa&rsquo;s sustainable development. The regional network will try to gather the green building councils across Africa for meaningful adoption of green building on the continent. According to Chege, the adoption of green practices is being hampered in part by the assumption that incorporating green practices is uneconomical. To this end, adds Chege, the meeting will try to unravel the hurdles that have delayed green buildings from gaining momentum. &ldquo;The discussion, perception and excuse that going green is expensive continues in many boardrooms of teams that are charged with developing our cities. &ldquo;Yet, on the other end of the spectrum, to no one&rsquo;s surprise, is the discussion on how much sustainability finance is available in Africa, most of which goes untouched year after year,&rdquo; says Chege.
