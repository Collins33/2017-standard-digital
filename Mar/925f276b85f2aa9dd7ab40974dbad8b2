While on your way to Nyanchwa estate on the outskirts of Kisii town you will definitely spot John Mokua who fetches and supplies water from Nyanchwa stream to earn a living. Mokua was brought up in Egesa location within Kisii in a family of four. He was the first born in the family. &ldquo;After my primary education, I could not go further with my studies because of poverty. I decided to look for a way to earn a living so I could help my parents support my younger siblings,&rdquo; he says. As his first job, Mokua landed a job working as a watchman but he was fired after a few years after his boss claimed he had a hand in a robbery at the company. &ldquo;It was after this that I joined a group of men who were supplying water in the town. We were five of us and we formed a bond that saw us support each other to grow,&rdquo; Mokua says. The business paid well and he was able to make Sh300 to Sh400 per day selling a 20-litre jerrican for Sh20 on a cart that could ferry 20 such containers in one trip. &ldquo;We all worked hard, making as many as six trips to the stream each day. We ensured that we saved some money and every year we bought a cart for one of our members and today we each have more than two such carts,&rdquo; he says. Mokua is now an employer with ten boys who help him supply water to his long-term clients each day. &ldquo;I now spend most of my time in the stream filling up the cans leaving the boys to do the delivery. I then go collect the cash from my clients at the end of the day,&rdquo; he says. Mokua says he collects between Sh15,000 and Sh20,000 per day and after paying his employees, he remains with a good amount that sees him take care of his family effortlessly.
