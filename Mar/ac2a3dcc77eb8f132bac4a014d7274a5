A section of West Pokot County residents have demonstrated against an operation to flush out bandits in Baringo and Kerio Valley, terming it biased and aimed at eliminating the Pokot community. The residents took to the streets in Makutano trading centre with placards denouncing the operation. Some of the placards read; &ldquo;Pokots have a right to be protected by the Government of Kenya. National government should bring us development, not guns.&rdquo; They said they wanted President Uhuru Kenyatta to withdraw the operation and dismissed Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s shoot to kill order. Led by Angole Kishesheu, the group claimed the government had isolated the Pokot. &ldquo;We need schools, hospitals and roads. We do not need an operation to oppress us. The DP is giving directives because he knows he will not be on the ballot box,&rdquo; said Kisheusheu.
