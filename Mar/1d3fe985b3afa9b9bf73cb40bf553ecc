Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga has stated that if the National Super Alliance (NASA) forms the next government, they will ensure the two-thirds gender rule is effected. Speaking at a meeting for ODM women leaders and aspirants at the Multimedia University yesterday, Raila said Kenya had come of age and that it was high time political parties embraced the culture of tolerance towards women and encouraged them to go for elective positions to achieve the two-thirds gender requirement in leadership. &ldquo;As ODM, we will continue supporting women. I therefore encourage you (women) to go for elective posts and win as many seats as possible in the August 8 General Election,&rdquo; he added. The former premier advised women not just to fight for the seats reserved for women but also go for constituency and county positions to be at par with their male counterparts. &ldquo;We in ODM consider women a special interest group and that is why we lowered the nomination&nbsp;fees&nbsp;for&nbsp;them&nbsp;to -&nbsp;enable&nbsp;them&nbsp;to&nbsp;apply&nbsp;to&nbsp;vie&nbsp;for as&nbsp;many&nbsp;seats&nbsp;as&nbsp;possible,&rdquo;&nbsp;said&nbsp;the&nbsp;NASA&nbsp;co-principal,&nbsp;adding&nbsp;&ldquo;we&nbsp;shall&nbsp;continue&nbsp;to&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;you&nbsp;(women) and&nbsp;empower&nbsp;you&nbsp;in&nbsp;ourparty&rdquo;. Raila however regretted that despite being an integral part of the country&rsquo;s development,&nbsp;women&nbsp;continued&nbsp;to be sidelined and to play a minimal role in the country&rsquo;s leadership.

Out of 1,450&nbsp;seats&nbsp;in the county assemblies, only 80&nbsp;women&nbsp;were elected. The rest were&nbsp;nominated. The Opposition chief also&nbsp;continued&nbsp;with his attack on the Jubilee administration, accusing it of presiding over high-level corruption at the expense of service delivery to the nation. He cited the Eurobond, National Youth Service and Ministry of Health scandals as major scams that had led to the deterioration of the country&rsquo;s economy. &ldquo;Yesterday (Sunday), I spoke about the scandal involving the expansion of the port of Mombasa, where billions of shillings cannot be accounted for.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;country now plays in the super league of the most corrupt countries in the world according to Transparency International.&nbsp;We&nbsp;can&rsquo;t&nbsp;continue&nbsp;like this,&rdquo; he&nbsp;said. ODM acting Secretary General Agnes Zani (nominated&nbsp;senator) reminded&nbsp;women&nbsp;that it was their determination that would see&nbsp;them&nbsp;elected to various positions on August 8. She&nbsp;said&nbsp;the era of&nbsp;women&nbsp;sitting back and waiting to vote for men was long gone and&nbsp;encouraged&nbsp;them&nbsp;to go out and seek votes. &ldquo;When a woman goes for an elective&nbsp;seat, she doesn&rsquo;t do it for herself alone, she does it for the whole society,&rdquo;&nbsp;said&nbsp;Ms Zani.

The more than 1,500&nbsp;women&nbsp;at the event declared their support for Raila, saying he was the most preferred&nbsp;NASA&nbsp;flag bearer candidate. &ldquo;As the&nbsp;women&nbsp;of the&nbsp;party,&nbsp;we&nbsp;have unanimously resolved to support&nbsp;our&nbsp;party&nbsp;leader for the top&nbsp;seat&nbsp;and urge the&nbsp;NASA&nbsp;team to appoint him as the torch-bearer in the August 8 General Election&rdquo;&nbsp;said&nbsp;Beth Syeng&rsquo;o, head of ODM&nbsp;Women&rsquo;s&nbsp;League. Those who spoke included National Elections Board chairperson Judith Pareno, Homa Bay County&nbsp;party&nbsp;chairperson Gladys Wanga, national vice chairperson and Christine Lemein.
