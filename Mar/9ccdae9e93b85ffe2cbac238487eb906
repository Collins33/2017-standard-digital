NAIROBI, KENYA: A day after Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka dismissed allegations that he is under pressure to quit the Opposition coalition for Jubilee, his lieutenants have come to his defence. Kalonzo, who is also a National Super Alliance (NASA) Co Principal and is gunning for the opposition&#39;s presidential flag, termed the perceived differences facing the two-month coalition as pure propaganda and lies that will be dealt with. &quot;This is all negative energy and propaganda. We will deal with it,&quot; said Kalonzo. Kalonzo has been on the spotlight with allegations that he was set to bolt from the opposition if he was not picked as the presidential flag bearer. Leaders from Ukambani have also accused National Intelligence Service (NIS) of driving propaganda to saw discord in the opposition.

The leaders were categorical that Kalonzo would rather remain in NASA where he is assured of position one or two than to be in Jubilee where he is not assured of any position. &quot;Kalonzo is not under any pressure to leave NASA and he will not. The propaganda is being fueled by our competitors to cause mistrust among Principals. My party leader has stated severally that he is in NASA to stay. We are holding him to his word,&quot; said Senator Mutula Jrn. But he cautioned that the opposition must determine the NASA Presidential candidate quickly to allay fears of its supporters in time.
