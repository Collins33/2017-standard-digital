Tucked&nbsp;away&nbsp;in the&nbsp;rugged&nbsp;terrain&nbsp;of the&nbsp;semi-arid&nbsp;Sigor&nbsp;lies&nbsp;the&nbsp;little-known&nbsp;Likwon&nbsp;Primary&nbsp;School. Established a decade ago, the&nbsp;school&nbsp;is in a state of disrepair and more than 200 pupils have been forced to grapple with infrastructural challenges. The&nbsp;school&nbsp;has only two classrooms and a mud-walled administration block that is in deplorable condition. The tiny administration block also acts as the staff room, kitchen and library as well as the head teacher&rsquo;s office. Most affected are the more than 85 nursery&nbsp;school&nbsp;children who are forced to learn under withered acacia trees outside despite their tender age. The two classrooms have pitiable five desks between them and most of the pupils sit on either the sun-baked ground or rocks. Salome Cheptoo, a nursery class teacher, said the&nbsp;school&nbsp;was first established as a nursery&nbsp;school&nbsp;before it was converted into a&nbsp;primary&nbsp;school.

Ms Cheptoo narrated how the children who, after walking long distances to the&nbsp;school, spent their class time dozing. The situation is exacerbated by hunger pangs and a lack of water at the institution. LEARNING SCHEDULES Daily, the pupils are required to take water to&nbsp;school, which has a negative impact on their learning schedules. &ldquo;When it rains, lessons are suspended because the water fills the two classrooms and the field where the nursery pupils are taught. The situation here is dire also because there is no sanitation,&rdquo; said Hosea Kalemnyam, the head teacher. He blamed successive leaders for neglecting the institution since it was opened by Wilson Lotole, a former&nbsp;MP. &ldquo;When our pupils graduate to Standard Four, they move to neighbouring&nbsp;schools&nbsp;more than four kilometres&nbsp;away,&rdquo; said Mr Kalemnyam.

From a distance, a structure made of rusted iron sheets, rafters and poles held together by patches of mud, most of which has fallen&nbsp;away&nbsp;due to age and weather effects, could easily pass for a sheep pen. But a look inside the rectangle structure that is partitioned into three rooms reveals desks and blackboards; the only reason to believe the ramshackle structure is actually a&nbsp;school&nbsp;building. The dusty floor in Standard Five East has damp patches as a result of water sprinkled by the pupils to settle the dust and ensure that lessons go on with less sneezing and coughing. BETTER DAYS Charles Kaprait, the&nbsp;school&rsquo;s&nbsp;chairman, said the dilapidated classrooms were established in 1951, when the&nbsp;school&nbsp;was founded. &ldquo;The classrooms have seen better days. My father used them before me and my children are using them now. During the rainy season, learning is disrupted because runoff water from the elevated end flows into the classrooms, which have no walls. The rooms become muddy and therefore unsuitable for learning,&rdquo; said Mr Kaprait, pointing to huge holes in the old walls.

Esther Kibor, a parent at the&nbsp;school, explained that the huge pupil population was due to the numerous families evicted from the forest who found alternative homes in the surrounding area. The neigbouring Chawis&nbsp;Primary&nbsp;School&nbsp;is about 10km&nbsp;away. Embobut experiences low temperatures of about 12 degrees Celsius. Mr Kaprait blamed area leaders for neglecting the needs of the&nbsp;school&nbsp;and giving empty promises whenever they visited. &ldquo;The MPs have been making pledges that they haven&rsquo;t fulfilled. For the past 15 years, they have built only three permanent classrooms from the Constituency Development Fund,&rdquo; he said.
