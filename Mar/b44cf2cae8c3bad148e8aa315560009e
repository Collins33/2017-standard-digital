There was drama at Shanzu law courts on Thursday when four drug trafficking suspects were freed by a magistrate after the State failed to charge them, only for them to be rearrested and charged. The four, including two Tanzanians, were arrested 20 days ago in a hotel in Mombasa and had not been charged by Thursday. But no sooner were they freed by Principal Magistrate Diana Mochache than police pounced on them as they walked out of the courthouse accompanied by their lawyers Jared Magolo and Cliff Ombeta. Within minutes of the fresh arrests, Nabil Mohamed, Stephen Mang&#39;ira and Tanzanians Bakari Kali and Lilian Martin were charged with 11 counts of drug trafficking and money laundering. The prosecution claims they were arrested with heroin and Sh18 million in cash. They denied. The drama began mid-morning when the magistrate rejected the prosecution&#39;s request to detain the suspects for 21 more days to enable them conclude investigations. &quot;We gave you five days, then two weeks and you have not presented any evidence to warrant the 21-day detention neither have you pressed any charges,&quot; said Mochache.
