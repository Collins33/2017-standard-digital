Coast politician and diplomat Chirau Ali Mwakwere yesterday announced that he will be seeking Kwale gubernatorial seat on&nbsp;Wiper Party ticket. The diplomat, who defected to Wiper yesterday, was received by party leader Kalonzo Musyoka at party headquarters in Nairobi. This is Mwakwere&#39;s second defection in less than a month since he recently decamped to ODM from Jubilee. Kalonzo, who announced that Wiper has secured strongholds in several parts of the country, said the party will field candidates eyeing Members of the County Assembly seats to gubernatorial positions in Coastal region. &quot;Those who think Kwale is under Jubilee Party will be surprised. Wiper will support Chirau&#39;s ambitions to vie for governorship and, as the party leader, I am convinced he will be the next governor of Kwale,&quot; said Kalonzo. Mwakwere, who vied for the Kwale senatorial seat on a United Republican Party ticket but lost to the late Boy Juma Boy in the last General Election, said he was not coerced to join the party.
