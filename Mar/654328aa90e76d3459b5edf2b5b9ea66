Jubilee leaders from Mount Kenya region have cautioned residents against voting for National Super Alliance (NASA) in the August 8 elections. Led by Senate Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki and Chuka Igambang&rsquo;ombe MP Muthomi Njuki, they said the region is experiencing growth as a result of President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s leadership. Mr Kindiki said NASA leaders have not done anything for the region since their days in government and should not dupe residents they will bring development now. Speaking when Mr Njuki launched his gubernatorial bid for Tharaka Nithi County, at Marimanti, Kindiki said NASA should not waste their time campaigning in the region. &ldquo;We and residents here only recognise President Uhuru&rsquo;s Jubilee Party. Jubilee is an organised outfit that has a clear agenda. We are like an army and are led by Uhuru, unlike a rudderless NASA who are yet to decide their presidential candidate,&rdquo; he said. - Phares Mutembei ALSO READ: Meeting to pick Jubilee elections board aborts after chaos erupt
