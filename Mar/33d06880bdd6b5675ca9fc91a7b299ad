NAIROBI, KENYA: Kenya plans to commence the roll out of ePassport from September 1, 2017. Immigration Department announced the push of the commencement from April to September 2017. Director, Immigration Services Maj Gen Gordon Kihalangwa said the postponement was due to unforeseen circumstances. &quot;Due to circumstances beyond our control, the roll-out will now be done as stated,&quot; said Kihalangwa in a statement. To get the ePassport, applicants will be required to apply for a replacement passport and then return their current passports. According to the department, the ePassport will have an electronic chip holding the same information as the old model passport, alongside a biometric identifier, digital photograph of the holder and security features to prevent unauthorized use and forgery. Details of the ePassport will be registered with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The new passport will cost the same as the current passport according to the Immigration Department. The document was initially set to be launched in December 2016 before it was pushed to April then to September 2017. The move is an East African initiative and ePassports will also be rolled out in other East African countries simultaneously.
