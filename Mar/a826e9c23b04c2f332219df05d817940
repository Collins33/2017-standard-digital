Boda boda riders have been banned from ferrying coffins on their motorcycles across all major towns in Western. The riders have also been cautioned against creating disturbance while escorting bodies for burial. Regional traffic police boss Geoffrey Njogu yesterday said those found violating the directive will be prosecuted. &quot;Ferrying bodies on motorcycles inconveniences other road users. Besides scaring people, it is also not healthy to carry bodies on a motorcycle that is used by other commuters. We have a special vehicle known as a hearse meant for that job,&quot; Mr Njogu said. It has become common for boda boda riders to escort bodies through major shopping centres while hooting and shouting in the name of mourning. Most riders are usually hired for that purpose.

The police boss warned that riders who get hired and turn the town into a mourning den would be arrested for violating traffic rules. &quot;It is only hearses or ambulances that are authorised to carry bodies. Carrying bodies on motorcycles is illegal. Let us mourn in a decent way and not creating disturbance on the road by riding in a careless way and causing accidents in the name of escorting the dead from the mortuary. Many people have died because of such carelessness,&quot; he said. He asked the riders to adhere to security measures and observe traffic rules to curb accidents and insecurity. &quot;Riders should be at the forefront to end road accidents by observing traffic rules and not carrying excess passengers,&quot; he noted. Every Thursday, business comes to a standstill as riders escorting bodies from the mortuary make noise and ride carelessly, creating commotion and inconveniencing other road users.
