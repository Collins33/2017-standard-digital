The police have warned politicians in Nyanza against inciting violence ahead of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) nominations scheduled for next month. Nyanza Regional Police Coordinator Willy Lugusa asked politicians to practise issue-based politics. He assured aspirants of enhanced security but warned that his officers would not tolerate any electoral violence. &#39;&#39;Those who are thinking or planning electoral mischief will be in for it. We are under firm instructions to ensure that the elections do not compromise the peaceful atmosphere in Nyanza,&quot; said Lugusa in a statement. He added that the police have intensified intelligence networking and patrols in Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, Migori, Nyamira, and Kisii counties. &#39;&#39;We will firmly deal with acts of lawlessness within the confines of the law,&quot; Lugusa said.
