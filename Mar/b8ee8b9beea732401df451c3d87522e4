Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has dismissed reports his party is set to quit the National Super Alliance (Nasa). Speaking at the Wiper headquarters in Nairobi on Thursday, Kalonzo declared that he is in Nasa to stay but he should not be blamed for popularising his party. &quot;I am here to present my nomination papers to my party for clearing as its presidential candidate in the August polls. This is the first step and the next is clinching the Nasa ticket,&quot; Kalonzo said. He was presented with a clearance certificate paving way for him to contest the presidency on Wiper ticket by National Elections Board (NEB) chairperson Agatha Solitei. He noted that being cleared by Wiper as the presidential candidate should not be misconstrued that he wants to go it alone. &quot;When I was Raila Odinga&#39;s running mate in 2013, Raila presented his papers to the IEBC as an ODM ticket while I did that on a Wiper ticket,&quot; the former Vice President said.

He also denied reports in a section of the media that some of his supporters have demanded that the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) he had with Raila in 2013 must be adhered to. &quot;That is in the past. We are now working on the future. In fact the three of us-myself, Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula are meeting on Saturday to discuss how we move forward,&quot; Kalonzo said.
