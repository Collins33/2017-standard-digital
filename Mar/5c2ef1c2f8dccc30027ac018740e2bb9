Tongaren residents have vowed to support Jubilee Party in the August elections, saying that they were tired of being in the opposition. Thousands of Ndalu, Wabukhonyi and Mbakalo who attended the party&#39;s rallies today said they had been been taken round and round by the opposition dating back to the days of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. &quot;We will support Governor Lusaka as well as Jubilee candidates in this region. The opposition has been selling propaganda which has been of no value to me as a resident,&quot; said Eliud Nyongesa from Wabukhonyi. This afternoon, the Jubilee Party leadership led by its national chairman Ken Lusaka, its Bungoma Chairman and Secretary General John Waluke and Hillary Chongwony, respectively, Bungoma County Woman Representative Reginalda Wanyonyi, Bumula MP Boniface Otsyula, among other key aspirants.&nbsp; &quot;Hatutaki kubaki nyuma kimaendeleo kwa kuwa kwenye upinzani. Twende serikalini pamoja tujenge county yenu,&quot; said Mr Waluke. Tomorrow, the Jubilee Team will be criss-crossing the vast Mt Elgon, the party&#39;s stronghold where it will hold major rallies in Cheptais, Kopsiro and Kapsokwony.
