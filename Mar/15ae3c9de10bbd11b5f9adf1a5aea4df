Rivalry between Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and his competitor&nbsp;Miguna&nbsp;Miguna&nbsp;played out Saturday when the duo met at Jericho Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) Church. Although they were seated next to each other and could be seen conversing,&nbsp;Miguna&nbsp;did not spare the county chief when he took to the pulpit, telling the congregation that Kidero &ldquo;is the outgoing Nairobi Governor&rdquo;. &ldquo;Elections, not selection, have to be done after every five years. This means that no position is a blank cheque. Right up from the presidency, to the MCA, everyone has to go and beg for votes if they want to be re-elected,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Miguna. But Kidero hit back, enumerating what Nairobi had gained from devolution under his leadership. He even asked&nbsp;Miguna&nbsp;to vote for him. &ldquo;I have listened to all that my brother&nbsp;Miguna&nbsp;has said, regarding the requirements we need to look at while electing leaders in the coming elections. I will be seeking the position of Nairobi Governor, and since I didn&rsquo;t hear you mention a particular seat you will be contesting, I hereby ask for your vote,&rdquo; Kidero said. Miguna&nbsp;pledged to give the church five bags of cement as &lsquo;sadaka&rsquo; (offering) for its new building. Meanwhile, National Super Alliance (NASA) principals Raila Odinga and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula Saturday said they will retain the city&rsquo;s gubernatorial post and win other elective positions.

We want to capture at least 13 out of the 17 constituencies and 53 out of the 85 wards in the city. I have been a legislator in Nairobi for 20 years and I know the dynamics. I will ensure we emerge victorious,&rdquo; he said. Those who have expressed interest in the post held by Kidero from Jubilee are Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru, former presidential candidate and Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth and former Starehe legislator Margaret Wanjiru. The four have already presented their nominations papers to run for the position.
