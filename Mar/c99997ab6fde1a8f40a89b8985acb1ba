Budalang&#39;i MP Ababu Namwamba has lashed out at the Opposition for always criticising projects by the Government. Speaking in his constituency during the launch of a youth empowerment project, Mr Ababu said leaders should not politicise everything the Government does. &quot;There are those people who always fight every project the Government initiates. When the Government came to recruit youths, some said it was a ploy to rig votes,&quot; said Ababu. The MP said he had decided to work with the Government for the sake of development. He said for many years his constituents had suffered due to lack of development and noted that since he started working with the Government, the constituency had received many developments projects. He cited the Sh1 billion Sigiri Bridge project that the Government has constructed in his constituency. &quot;Politics of rhetoric is long gone because people want to see development and that is why Budalang&#39;i is growing so fast,&quot; he said.
