Ugenya MP David Ochieng&#39; has said he does not regret quitting the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) and that he is confident of retaining his seat on his new Movement for Democracy and Growth (MDG) party ticket. Mr Ochieng&#39;, who is the first sitting MP to defect from the Orange party this season, said whoever will be picked by ODM to contest against him should prepare for &#39;a massive defeat&#39; because his constituents will look beyond party line and re-elect him on August 8 because of his development record. Speaking in his constituency on Friday, during the first graduation ceremony at Ugenya Teachers Training College, one of his pet projects, Ochieng&#39; said he quit the Orange party because of threats from senior party officials envious of his development record. &quot;When I built a medical training college, I was branded a Jubilee mole; when I constructed Ugenya Teachers Training College, I was threatened that I would not receive the ODM certificate. Every development project to my people has been accompanied with a threat,&quot; he said. Ochieng&#39; is set to compete with several aspirants, including former Standard Digital Editor David Ohito, who will be vying on an ODM ticket.
