Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader Alfred Mutua has supported the move by the anti-graft body to investigate governors suspected of embezzling public funds. The Machakos governor said the investigation should be extended to all public office bearers and action taken against those found to have looted public funds. Speaking during a popularisation tour of Embu County, Mutua lashed out at people who seek political office as a ladder to quick riches by stealing public funds. He also announced that his party will not issue tickets to individuals linked to corruption. Speaking at a rally in Embu after meeting aspirants who will run on the MCC party ticket, Mutua condemned the emerging culture of political intolerance.
