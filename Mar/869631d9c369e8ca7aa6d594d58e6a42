The fate of Budalang&#39;i MP Ababu Namwamba in the Labour Party of Kenya (LPK), which he joined after ditching ODM, hangs in the balance. This follows a ruling&nbsp;on Monday by the Political Party&#39;s Dispute Tribunal, led by Kyalo Mbobu and Milly Odongo, ordering Mr Namwamba&#39;s membership and party leadership suspended until a petition challenging his status is heard and determined. LKP&nbsp;member John Barasa moved to the tribunal, arguing that Namwamba was a pretender to the party&#39;s membership and leadership. The petitioner sought orders to stop Namwamba from acting as a member or official of the party as well as a permanent injunction against to stop the MP from purporting to act on behalf of the party. &quot;On several occasions, the respondent (Namwamba) has acted and continued to act in a manner misleading to the public that he is a member of LPK,&quot; read the petition filed by Barasa. He also swore an affidavit saying &quot;Ababu is a member of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM)... he is infringing LPK political rights by holding himself out as a member and a party leader, which is contrary to the LPK constitution and Article 38 of the Constitution of Kenya.&quot; ALSO READ: Tribunal overturns ODM'S decision to expel Ababu Namwamba Barasa was disturbed that LPK minutes from meetings held last November 10 and 22 labelled Ababu as a party leader. He tabled a list of all LPK members, saying it did not have Ababu&#39;s name, and another of ODM members where the MP is listed. The matter will be heard on March 9. Party leader Julia Ojiambo read malice in the whole matter. &quot;I think someone paid Barasa to cause problems in the party. If Barasa has issues with Ababu, he should sort them elsewhere,&quot; she said. Ojiambo also said efforts to establish whether Barasa was a party member had been fruitless.
