Embattled Labour Party of Kenya (LPK) leader Ababu Namwamba has accused the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) of harbouring bitterness after he decamped from the party. He blamed ODM for causing confusion in the LPK leadership to make it unpopular ahead of the General Election. &quot;As a party, we have absolutely no time for juvenile antics by political amateurs acting at the behest of some bitter ex (ODM) that has simply refused to move on. We tell you that we moved on. Move on too, otherwise if you don&#39;t that bile will kill you,&quot; said the Budalang&#39;i MP in Eldoret after attending a national women&#39;s congress. Earlier this week, the Political Party&#39;s Dispute Tribunal ordered Namwamba&#39;s membership and party leadership suspended until a petition challenging his status is heard and determined.
