President Uhuru Kenyatta will be the guest of honour in a school that his father commissioned more than 50 years ago. According to Philip Njogu, a member of the Board of Management of Nyambaria Boys High School, former President Jomo Kenyatta laid the foundation stone of the institution, which would later become the only national school in Nyamira County.&nbsp; Mr Njogu said the Senior Kenyatta was hosted by the then Kitutu Masaba MP Makone Ombese in 1966. Nyamira County Assembly Speaker Joash Nyamoko, who is among those organising the visit, confirmed that the President would visit the school during his tour of the region. But even as the President visits the school, not much has changed in the compound where his father took a meal of roasted blood, brown ugali and traditional liquor, which was served in&nbsp;ekee,&nbsp;a special traditional bowl. The same bowl will be used to serve Uhuru with special porridge during his visit. Uhuru will also commission a dormitory block, which now occupies the space where his father was hosted by Gusii elders.
