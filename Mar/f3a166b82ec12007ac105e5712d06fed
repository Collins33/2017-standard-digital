A human rights lobby has appealed to the&nbsp;Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate officials of four counties in Rift Valley over graft allegations. The programmes coordinator of the Centre for Human Rights and Development in Eldoret, Kipkorir Ng&#39;etich, said the officials named in the Auditor-General&#39;s report of 2015 should not be cleared to vie for political office until they were exonerated. &nbsp;Mr Ng&#39;etich said the officials from Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia, Elgeyo Marakwet, and Nandi counties were linked to cartels that have been awarded tenders. &nbsp;&quot;We will not allow people of questionable character to run for public office,&quot; he said. -Joan Letting
