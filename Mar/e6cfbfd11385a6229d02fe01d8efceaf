Taita-Taveta Senator Dan Mwazo&nbsp;dismissed claims that he was bought to join Jubilee Party. He termed the allegations from ODM leaders in Coast as propaganda and out to tarnish his name. &nbsp;&quot;I made an impartial decision based solely on facts and my own volition. My decision was also based on the welfare of the local community who want to be in government,&quot; said Mwazo. &nbsp;The senator, together with Woman Representative Joyce Wanjala Lay, were received to the JP by President Uhuru Kenyatta in Voi town last week. According to ODM leaders, the former Cabinet Minister is alleged to have received Sh300 million to abandon the opposition.
