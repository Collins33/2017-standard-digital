Mamboleo slaughterhouse is being repaired at a cost of Sh12 million, county officials have said. The renovation includes fencing and building of a new abattoir to improve quality services. &nbsp;This is one of the new measures being taken by the county to boost public health. The repairs come amid public complaints that animals were being slaughtered in filthy abattoirs. &nbsp;According to Agriculture and Livestock Chief Officer Benjamin Angir, focus will not only be on Mamboleo abattoir but plans are on course to build more modern slaughter houses, complete with water supplies. The modern slaughter houses would also have ablution blocks and public toilets to improve sanity. On a good day, the slaughterhouse can take up to 30 animals. Veterinary boss Teresa Opiyo said they wanted to stop bad butcher practices.&nbsp; ALSO READ: No one mocked 'suicide' girl, says Kisumu principal
