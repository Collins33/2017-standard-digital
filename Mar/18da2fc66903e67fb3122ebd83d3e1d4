Three people have been charged with defrauding job-seekers millions of shillings by promising them jobs as airline cabin crew and pilots. John Odhiambo Majiwa and Elizabeth Wanjiru Kinyanjui were accused of luring over 40 job seekers by promising them special training in South Africa, Dubai and Canada before offering them jobs in an airline called&nbsp;Baracuda Airways. They were charged alongside the &#39;airline&#39; accountant, Stella Ivy Amaya. The court heard that the accused were arrested on February 24 and 25, 2017 after public complaints. The prosecution said that on February 22, 2017 more than 21 complainants paid Sh9.7 million into an account at Standard Chartered Bank belonging to the firm. Majiwa and Wanjiru, the court heard, are listed as holders of the accounts where the funds were deposited.

But when the complainants visited the company&#39;s offices at Equity Building along Argwings Kodhek road, Nairobi, they found its doors closed. They all denied the charges and were released on Sh1 million cash bail each or a bond of Sh2 million.
