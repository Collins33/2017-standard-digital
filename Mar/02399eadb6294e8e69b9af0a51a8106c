The Jubilee Party has warned that it might consider locking out Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, two governors, and a member of Parliament from its primaries because of poll violence. The President&#39;s party has zeroed in on Mr Sonko, governors Mwangi wa Iria (Murang&#39;a) and Joseph Ndathi (Kirinyaga), and MP David Gekaria (Nakuru Town East) for being responsible for the violence witnessed during the selection of the party&#39;s county election boards. The party&#39;s Disciplinary Committee, chaired by Lumatete Muchai, has said it would issue summonses to the members accused of perpetrating violence to appear before it for disciplinary action. &quot;Summonses shall be served upon these members setting out the date, venue, and time when they should defend themselves,&quot; said a statement signed by the party&#39;s Secretary-General, Raphael Tuju. Addressing a press briefing at the party&#39;s headquarters in Nairobi, Mr Muchai said the leaders risked being disqualified from participating in the party primaries, warning that the outfit would not allow chaos among its members. He said the members would choose to appear in person or be represented by their lawyers in the hearings, explaining that the verdict would be made public within 48 hours upon issuance of summons.

The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has said party primaries should be held between April 13 and 26. Chaotic scenes were witnessed in Nairobi, Nakuru, Kirinyaga, Kiambu, Murang&#39;a, and Kajiado counties in the elections to pick the county officials who will preside over the Jubilee primaries. In Nakuru, the process was disrupted when Mr Gikaria was involved in a fist-fight with his rival&#39;s supporters. And at Nairobi&#39;s Bomas of Kenya, the election was disrupted by the supporters of Sonko and Starehe MP Maina Kamanda over claims of rigging. In Kirinyaga, Governor Ndathi&#39;s allies clashed with the supporters of former Planning and Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru. In Murang&#39;a, Governor Iria&#39;s supporters locked horns with Kigumo MP Jamaleck Kamau&#39;s allies.
