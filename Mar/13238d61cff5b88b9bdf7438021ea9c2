The grant from the Africa&#39;s Development Infrastructure Project Preparation Facility (NEPAD-IPPF) will facilitate the preparation of Lamu Port Project (LPP) for making it a viable venture for investment by private firms. Lamu Port Project which is part of Lamu Port Southern Sudan Ethiopia Transit (LAPSSET) corridor is seeking to transit into a Public Private Partnership (PPP).
