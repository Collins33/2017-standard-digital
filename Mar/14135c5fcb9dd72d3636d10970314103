The National Super Alliance (NASA) principals yesterday moved to quell fears of a fallout. Speaking at Kitengela, Kajiado County on Sunday, the leaders displayed a show of camaraderie and unity and sought to dispel reports that some of them were angling to leave the alliance. Three principals - Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Moses Wetang&#39;ula (Ford Kenya), and Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress) - assured their supporters that they would face Jubilee as one team.&nbsp; Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga did not attend the rally as he is in the US. The NASA principals denied media reports that they were divided, saying that each one of them was ready to support whoever would be named the coalition&#39;s presidential flag-bearer. &quot;Propagandists, bloggers, and naysayers are saying myself and Wetang&#39;ula are leaving NASA. These are shameless rumours that have no basis. We are in NASA to stay,&quot; Musyoka told a cheering crowd. He denied reports that he was planning to go it alone in the August polls. &quot;There are sycophants in NASA who do not want others to speak freely. These are the ones who have said that I was leaving immediately I presented my nomination papers to my party last week,&quot; Musyoka said.

He added that he was ready to support any one of the four principals who would be named the flag-bearer. &quot;I will support Raila again because I have supported him before. I am willing to support Wetang&#39;ula and Mudavadi. But if I am named as the NASA flag-bearer, I am focused and willing to carry the mantle,&quot; he said. Wetang&#39;ula echoed Musyoka&#39;s sentiments, insisting that NASA was united and that the leaders were working together as a team. &quot;You have heard many things but I can tell you that Raila, myself, and Kalonzo have been together for four years. Now Mudavadi has joined us. None of us is stupid to leave NASA,&quot; said the Bungoma Senator. He said the principals had met and agreed that they would support the one who is given the presidential ticket.

The country is ready for NASA to deliver them from Jubilee&#39;s poor leadership,&quot; he said. Mudavadi said it was normal for NASA to have misunderstandings but that they would be sorted out. &quot;There is heat in the NASA house but that is normal. We will overcome the small problems and name our flag-bearer,&quot; Mudavadi said. He added that whoever leaves the alliance would be betraying the will of Kenyans. &quot;I am willing to support any one of us,&quot; he said.
