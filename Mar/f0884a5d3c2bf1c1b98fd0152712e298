Zuku Fiber, a member of the Wananchi Group, has unveiled what it says is the fastest Internet speed in the country at 250Mbps. Group Chief Executive Thomas Hintze said in a statement yesterday the package,&nbsp;dubbed Home Advanced 250Mbps, is designed to meet the evolving needs of customers for streaming short videos, movies, real-time gaming and live video chats. Such services require higher bandwidth and low latency Internet services. The package comes a year after Zuku Fiber announced it would invest Sh2.6 billion to upgrade its network infrastructure and services. It includes 250Mbps Internet speed, premium TV content through Zuku TV, a free cable modem for Internet service, a free TV set-top box and telephony services. To celebrate the milestone, Mr Hintze said, all Zuku Fiber customers will in due course have their current Internet packages&#39; speeds upgraded by up to 66 per cent at the same price they are currently paying.
