I&nbsp;always&nbsp;look&nbsp;forward&nbsp;to&nbsp;interactions&nbsp;with&nbsp;one&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;long&nbsp;time&nbsp;clients&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Makumi, a&nbsp;pig&nbsp;farmer&nbsp;in&nbsp;Nyambare,&nbsp;Limuru&nbsp;near&nbsp;Uplands&nbsp;Beacon&nbsp;Factory.&nbsp;My&nbsp;first encounter with&nbsp;Makumi&nbsp;was during our fifth year practical ambulatory classes; when we visited his farm. Our friendship was however cemented latter in life when I brought another friend who was preparing to get into&nbsp;pig&nbsp;farming to learn a few tips;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Makumi&nbsp;has ever since consulted me on numerous occasions on issues relating to&nbsp;pig&nbsp;health. Stinking pigsty I got lots of interest in what&nbsp;Makumi&nbsp;was doing because&nbsp;pig&nbsp;farming is something I have been&nbsp;longing&nbsp;to venture into but&nbsp;one&nbsp;thing has&nbsp;always&nbsp;kept me from taking that first step &ndash; a spacious farm. Management of&nbsp;pig&nbsp;waste is the greatest challenge in&nbsp;pig&nbsp;farming; you will certainly get into problems with your neighbours over the stench that emanates from&nbsp;pig&nbsp;sty. This dream which is still valid to date has kept our friendship alive. In January this year&nbsp;Makumi&nbsp;called me with a rather absurd case. He had observed an abnormal behaviour in &mdash; the weaners and growers. These two groups had about 20&nbsp;pigs&nbsp;each out of which about ten had their tails bitten to varying degrees. Two&nbsp;pigs&nbsp;were almost tailless and seemed to be in a lot of pain by the&nbsp;time&nbsp;Makumi&nbsp;was calling me to intervene. Although this is a vice we had been taught at the vet school, this was the first&nbsp;time&nbsp;I was encountering it in&nbsp;my&nbsp;practical professional life. On arriving on the farm I noticed that the two affected group of&nbsp;pigs&nbsp;were overcrowded in their sty. This isn&rsquo;t a good thing for any domestic animal. The area; which is normally cold was particularly hot perhaps adding to the crowding stress. ALSO READ: Want healthy herd? Keep them far from swamps The situation on the farm wasn&rsquo;t very good; almost all the&nbsp;pigs&nbsp;in these two groups had tail bite wounds. This was going to cost&nbsp;Makumi&nbsp;dearly when selling off the stock; tail wounds aren&rsquo;t good for the carcass quality. They can be infected and this can permeate the whole body resulting in lowered carcass value or outright condemnation of the carcass.&nbsp;Makumi&nbsp;was staring at an eminent loss in a year. I isolated the affected&nbsp;pigs&nbsp;and treated them with a topical antibiotic spray and antibiotic spray to take care of any secondary bacterial infections. But that wasn&rsquo;t enough; in such cases you need to investigate the cause of this vice an exercise that was a bit complex. After close monitoring, I was able to identify&nbsp;one&nbsp;&ldquo;bully&rdquo;&nbsp;pig&nbsp;among the growers group which I observed severally attempting to bit others tails. But this wasn&rsquo;t the root cause of the problem;&nbsp;Makumi&nbsp;had complained how feeding the&nbsp;pigs&nbsp;was a burden considering that he had just paid school fees &ndash; I knew the&nbsp;pigs&nbsp;weren&rsquo;t getting enough for their stomachs another cause of stress and probably the biting. Makumi&nbsp;was also dealing with a large number of&nbsp;pigs&nbsp;that were a strain to his housing capacity &ndash; they were overstocked coupled by generally high ambient temperatures at the&nbsp;time. Tail biting in&nbsp;pigs&nbsp;is a serious vice that many&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;have to deal with in herds. In fact no system is immune from this vice.&nbsp;Pigs&nbsp;have a natural tendency to investigate their environment using their mouth and to chew. Red colour like happens in bleeding is a trigger to biting. Normally the end of the tail is not as sensitive and that is how a bite isn&rsquo;t noticed initially, as it progresses bleeding follows a stage that naturally attracts others to continue the biting. This problem is common when the animal is&nbsp;one, seven and eight months, a period during which&nbsp;pigs&nbsp;undergo teething.
