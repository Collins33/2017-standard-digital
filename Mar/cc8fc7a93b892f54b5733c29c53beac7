In&nbsp;my&nbsp;work&nbsp;as a&nbsp;vet,&nbsp;I&nbsp;have&nbsp;noticed&nbsp;one&nbsp;thing&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;are not&nbsp;keen&nbsp;on the&nbsp;poultry&nbsp;rearing&nbsp;system&nbsp;they&nbsp;select. They&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;randomly&nbsp;without&nbsp;factoring&nbsp;in&nbsp;key&nbsp;considerations. Before you pick a&nbsp;system, you need to consider the breed of chicken, production purpose, growth rate and number of chicken&nbsp;reared. The commonest methods of&nbsp;poultry&nbsp;rearing&nbsp;fall under three groups &mdash; semi-intensive, intensive and free range&nbsp;systems. Free Range&nbsp;system This is the most common and is practised in many rural households. Most homesteads will normally&nbsp;have&nbsp;between five to 30 birds. The kienyeji breed is&nbsp;reared&nbsp;in this type of&nbsp;system. The birds are left to scavenge outside and cater for their own nutritional requirements. Birds feed on insects, worms and occasionally get supplemental feed including leftovers and cereals. The birds spend the night in a poorly constructed&nbsp;poultry&nbsp;house or the main house. The birds are used as a source of extra income to the owner or for consumption in the household. Production and growth rate for these indigenous birds is low since feed obtained from scavenging is not enough to meet their daily nutritional needs. There are high chances of losing the birds through predation and&nbsp;poultry&nbsp;thieves. ALSO READ: Why do my pigs bite off each others tails? Semi-intensive&nbsp;system In this case the birds are left to scavenge during the day and at night they move into a well structured&nbsp;poultry&nbsp;house. The birds kept under this management&nbsp;system&nbsp;are more productive than those in free range since supplemental feed is offered. During the day the birds roam in a restricted fenced-in area and therefore monitoring is done and predation is therefore checked. What you need Laying boxes, feeders and drinking troughs are provided inside the&nbsp;poultry&nbsp;house. Most&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;have&nbsp;the birds inside the coop and feed them during the hot morning hours and later let the birds scavenge outside in the cooler part of the day. Supplementation is done with commercially purchased feeds which provide most of the nutrition requirement to the bird. The birds also receive the necessary treatment when they fall sick. Most&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;vaccinate their birds against the important diseases for instance, Gumboro and Newcastle depending on the region. The birds&rsquo; production purpose is geared towards profit-making. This&nbsp;system&nbsp;is ideal for the indigenous chicken and most&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;are now opting for the improved indigenous chicken like the KARI improved Kienyeji due to faster growth rate and high productivity of eggs. The birds are better protected in cases of harsh climatic conditions, for instance during rainy season - they remain housed. Record keeping is recommended to help the&nbsp;farmer&nbsp;calculate the profit/loss. The size of land utilised determines the number of birds to be&nbsp;reared. Intensive production&nbsp;system ALSO READ: How app helps Kenyan farmers manage farm books This is totally market-oriented and the number of birds&nbsp;reared&nbsp;ranges from hundreds to thousands. Capital investment is higher compared to the other&nbsp;systems. Farm inputs ranging from housing, brooder, feeds, feeders and drinkers, heat source, vaccines to bio-security related inputs must be&nbsp;factored&nbsp;in. Chicken kept under this management&nbsp;system&nbsp;include improved kienyeji, as well as broilers and layers. Intensive management&nbsp;system&nbsp;can be divided into two main categories &mdash; deep litter and battery cage. In deep litter&nbsp;system, the floor has about 4 to 6 inches of litter. They litter include wood shavings, rice and coffee husks. In battery cage&nbsp;system, birds especially exotic layers are housed in cages that hold about 4 to 6 birds per cage. The birds&nbsp;have&nbsp;no access to movement around the house. High initial capital investment of purchase and installation of cages is required.
