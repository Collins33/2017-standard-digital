An association of macadamia farmers has called on the government to arrest unscrupulous traders smuggling macadamia nuts to China through Tanzania. In a letter to the Commissioner, Investigations and Enforcement Department, Kenya Revenue Authority, Nuts Processors Association Managing Director Charles Muigai said the illegal business was hurting farmers and the economy. &ldquo;These shadowy operators have been in the business for a long time and keep changing their business name to evade taxes and cover their operations,&rdquo; said Mr Muigai. &nbsp;The ban on smuggling of the nuts in 2013 has failed to deter the traders. &ldquo;According to International Nuts Council statistics, Tanzania is exporting over 3,000 metric tonnes annually of in shell macadamia yet the country is not a producer of macadamia nuts,&rdquo; he said. He said Thika and Mulolongo are routes of the illegal trade. ALSO READ: Adverse weather conditions hurting tea farmers
