SYDNEY: A diet that boosts good bacteria in the stomach could be key to reducing the risk of diabetes, an Australian study has found. Researchers from Melbourne&#39;s Monash University found for the first time that a diet rich in fermentable fibre stopped mice from developing type 1 diabetes. The fibre was administered to the mice in the form of a powder sprinkled on their regular food and plans for a human trial were underway. The diet&#39;s combination of starches is broken down by stomach bacteria to produce acetate and butyrate, short-chain fatty acids that are a key part of keeping the immune system healthy. &quot;We think that metabolites have anti-inflammatory effects and they do remarkable things in every single major disease we look at: cardiovascular &not;disease, food allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma,&quot; lead researcher Charles Mackay told News Limited on Tuesday.

It could be a tremendous way to get our gut back to good health and prevent these inflammatory diseases.&quot; Approximately 1.2 million Australians suffer from diabetes, making it one of the nation&#39;s most significant health issues.
