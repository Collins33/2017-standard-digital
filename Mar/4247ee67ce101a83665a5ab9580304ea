Kilimall is wooing women to online shopping to grow its market share in Kenya. The online shopping mall has launched a campaign to celebrate female customers ahead of the International Women&rsquo;s Day to be observed on March 8. The e-commerce firm has launched a campaign dubbed #BeBoldwithKilimall, in line with this year&rsquo;s International Women&rsquo;s Day theme &lsquo;Be Bold for Change&rsquo;. Under the campaign, prices of various products targeted at women &mdash; fashion, household items, smartphones, bags and beauty products &mdash; have been slashed by up to 50 per cent. The campaign &mdash; which runs between March 10 and 27 &mdash; is aimed at increasing women&rsquo;s confidence in shopping online. Kilimall Kenya Managing Director Victor Ma said Kilimall is seeking to win the confidence of women shoppers as it strives to make e-commerce a lifestyle in Kenya. The winners of the social media competition will be announced on the International Women&rsquo;s Day.
