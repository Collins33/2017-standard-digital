A&nbsp;few&nbsp;years&nbsp;ago, there was a&nbsp;craze&nbsp;on&nbsp;rabbit&nbsp;urine.&nbsp;Every&nbsp;rabbit&nbsp;farmer&nbsp;in&nbsp;town&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;how&nbsp;they&nbsp;had&nbsp;found&nbsp;a &lsquo;minefield&rsquo; in&nbsp;rabbit&nbsp;urine. Some fell into scams but others hit some &lsquo;jackpot&rsquo; with this liquid fertiliser. One such&nbsp;farmer&nbsp;who says he got it right and is making a kill is Peter Kagereki. He runs Kagereki&nbsp;Rabbits&nbsp;Ranch in Mbuinjeru village, Embu County. He packages&nbsp;rabbit&nbsp;urine&nbsp;(foliar fertiliser) which he brands as Ecoboost Foliar Fertiliser. He has a&nbsp;found&nbsp;a ready market from individual&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;and institutions with farms. &ldquo;I started selling&nbsp;foliar fertiliser three&nbsp;years&nbsp;ago&nbsp;after my&nbsp;rabbit&nbsp;business flopped,&rdquo; he says. Kagereki, who has a degree in marketing from Chuka University, started rearing&nbsp;rabbits&nbsp;in 2006 while in Form One as a hobby. ALSO READ: Why do my pigs bite off each others tails? Back then from three&nbsp;rabbits, Kagereki&rsquo;s project expanded the bunch to hundreds of&nbsp;rabbits, which he would sell to neighbours and friends. After university, he decided to transform the&nbsp;rabbit&nbsp;project into an agribusiness. Online research &ldquo;Things were good for a while because I never lacked buyers for my&nbsp;rabbits. But there was a time the market was flooded with&nbsp;rabbits&nbsp;and that is&nbsp;how&nbsp;the prices started to dip. The price of a mature doe and buck went really low, it became a non viable business idea,&rdquo; he recalls. He lost hundreds of&nbsp;rabbits, because he&nbsp;had&nbsp;to sell them at throw away prices. To avoid past mistakes, on his new venture, he decided to do research. Kagereki hit the blogosphere digging information on other ways he could earn from&nbsp;rabbits. He landed a gold mine of information on YouTube on&nbsp;how&nbsp;to make foliar fertiliser from&nbsp;rabbit&rsquo;s&nbsp;urine. That is&nbsp;how&nbsp;he started religiously collecting&nbsp;urine&nbsp;from his 60 remaining&nbsp;rabbits. He has constructed&nbsp;rabbit&nbsp;houses in such a way that&nbsp;urine&nbsp;is collected and drained into a filling container. ALSO READ: Poultry 101: Free range or cage? Apart from the&nbsp;urine, the other raw material he needs for the mixture is molasses and corn starch. &ldquo;I mix it in a certain ratio. I learnt&nbsp;how&nbsp;to mix the ratios on YouTube. After mixing, I store the mixture in a tank for three weeks during which aerobic reaction takes place. This is basically fermentation which ensures good bacteria remain intact,&rdquo; he says. To roll out the project, he used his savings to buy the equipment needed such as weighing machines, containers, bottles and a motorcycle for transporting the fertiliser locally. &ldquo;Foliar fertiliser is organic and thus environmentally friendly. It produces ammonia which acts as a repellent to pests,&rdquo; he says. He says the fertiliser is absorbed by a plant faster as it enters directly through pores unlike others that enter through roots. Marketing factor How&nbsp;did he market the fertiliser?

The crops were healthy and my yields were good,&rdquo; he recalls. Having seen the evidence on my farm, slowly more&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;started making their orders. At the moment, demand is so solid, he buys&nbsp;urine&nbsp;from other&nbsp;rabbit&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;at Sh50 per litre. He has 10&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;who supply him about 1,000 litres of&nbsp;rabbit&nbsp;urine&nbsp;per month. Quality is a key factor, he says. &ldquo;I always sieve the&nbsp;urine&nbsp;I buy to remove impurities. I also test it to ensure it is pure,&rdquo; he says. He sells the fertiliser through direct marketing to schools and individual&nbsp;farmers. His clientele base is as far as Nyahururu, Nakuru and Nairobi. He regularly attends agricultural exhibitions like the annual ASK shows, where he sources for more clients.

He sells a litre of the fertiliser at Sh200. When that quantity is mixed with 50 litres of water, it can be used to spray an acre of crops. He also earns from selling mature&nbsp;rabbits&nbsp;at between Sh1,000 for slaughter and Sh2,500 for breeding. &ldquo;Those for slaughter are cheaper as I skin them and sell the skin to shoes or bag manufacturing companies,&rdquo; he says. The farm has 200 hybrid&nbsp;rabbits&nbsp;after he recently sold some 100. He rears Flemish Giant, Chinchilla, Giant Checkered, New Zealand White, Dutch&nbsp;Rabbits&nbsp;and California White among other breeds. Though things are looking up for this&nbsp;farmer, he faces hurdles. One is serious water shortage due to the prevailing drought. To beat this, the&nbsp;farmer&nbsp;has adopted ingenious water conservation methods that he learnt from the Internet. &ldquo;I do not let water from the bathroom go into waste. I collect and filters it using sand and charcoal. The resultant water is de-soaped which can be used to irrigate crops.&rdquo; He also covers his crops using polythene papers (mulching) to conserve water.
