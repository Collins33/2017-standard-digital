Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) leader Charity Ngilu have closed ranks in an effort to cement the opposition&#39;s fortunes in Ukambani. &nbsp;In what appears to be a mending of political fences ahead of the August polls, at least five parties have thrown their weight behind Musyoka to be the NASA flag bearer. Party leaders Ngilu, Wavinya Ndeti (Chama Cha Uzalendo), Mutua Katuku (People&#39;s Trust Party), and former Muungano Party leader and Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana resolved to work together.&nbsp; Musyoka welcomed the resolution during a meeting at a Nairobi hotel yesterday.
