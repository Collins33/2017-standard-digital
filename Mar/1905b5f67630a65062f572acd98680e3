A number of Jubilee Party aspirants in Kilifi County have expressed fears that the party's primaries may be skewed to favour recent defectors to the ruling coalition. The aspirants want the party headquarters to declare that no one will be favoured and order the primaries to be conducted using national identity cards instead of the smart cards, which they claim are scarce. Kilifi North parliamentary aspirant Esther Kache and senatorial aspirant Chenje Mwachiro demanded free and fair primaries. Mr Mwachiro claimed recent defectors who met top party leaders in State House Nairobi alleged they had been endorsed to vie in August.
