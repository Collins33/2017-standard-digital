Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said it was time for him to &quot;grow up&quot; and get help after a video was published showing him getting into an argument with a driver for the ride service who complained about pay rates. Bloomberg on Tuesday published a video of Kalanick, a co-founder of the company, arguing with a driver who tells him that rates have been cut and he has lost money. The 40-year-old Kalanick responds angrily that some people don&#39;t take responsibility for their own actions. The video is the latest in a series of challenges and embarrassments for the ride service. Last week, Alphabet Inc&#39;s self-driving vehicle unit Waymo sued Uber for allegedly stealing designs related to autonomous vehicles, a claim that Uber has denied. Uber also is investigating allegations of sexual harassment in its own organization. Earlier this month, a female former engineer at Uber said in a widely read blog post that managers and human resources officers at the company had not punished her manager after she reported his unwanted sexual advances, and even threatened her with a poor performance review. In the video published by Bloomberg on Tuesday, the driver in a dash cam tells Kalanick, a passenger, that &quot;people are not trusting you anymore,&quot; and complains that rates for drivers have fallen. Kalanick responds, &quot;Some people don&#39;t like to take responsibility for their own mess. They blame everything in their life on somebody else. Good luck!&quot; In his statement released later on Tuesday, Kalanick said he was ashamed for treating the driver disrespectfully, and he apologized to the driver and others. &quot;It&rsquo;s clear this video is a reflection of me - and the criticism we&rsquo;ve received is a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it,&quot; he wrote.
