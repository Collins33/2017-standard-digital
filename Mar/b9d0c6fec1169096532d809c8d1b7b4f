Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana wants National Super Alliance (NASA) luminaries Raila Odinga, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang&#39;ula to support Kalonzo for the presidency. Prof Kibwana, a close Kalonzo ally, said only the Wiper leader could deliver a NASA presidency. &quot;There are people expressing fears that the government system has perfected a way to beat Raila at every election. &nbsp;I am sure Raila can trounce such defeatist notions easily through Kalonzo if the latter is allowed to fly the NASA flag,&quot; said Kibwana at Ivingoni/ Nzambani ward, where he commissioned several development projects on Wednesday.
