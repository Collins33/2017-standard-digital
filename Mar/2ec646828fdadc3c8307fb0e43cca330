Like any living thing, a newspaper must renew itself. The need for a fresh coat of paint and captivating content takes newsrooms through bouts of self-examination every decade or so, bringing regular features and columns under scrutiny as editors and marketing executives argue over what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. Today we present to you the latest reincarnation of Kenya&rsquo;s oldest newspaper, The Standard. It&rsquo;s a cross between the old and the new; certainly not a radical reinvention of the 115-year-old news companion you have grown to love and trust. &nbsp;What we have is a newspaper that attempts to cure our weaknesses while fulfilling the reading requirements of the digital-age news consumer. With more and more readers turning to digital platforms for news and comment, the printed newspaper has little choice but to reaffirm its relevance. The Standard in its new form seeks to be more than just a source of news &mdash; we want to give you practical value for your daily life and continue to be a source of news as well as a voice of justice. We have an array of new sections that will most certainly keep you informed, entertained and educated. All this and much more define the new-look Standard. We hope you enjoy it. &nbsp; &nbsp;
