The Government has launched the construction of a multi-billion shilling rehabilitation centre in Miritini Mombasa County to combat drug addiction. The centre is expected to house drug addicts from the six coastal counties. Coast Regional Coordinator Nelson Marwa Friday said the construction of the centre follows President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s directive early this year. Marwa observed that the initiative will offer a new approach in dealing with drug addiction. The coordinator also said that the Government will also eradicate the barons and their cartels. &ldquo;The Government will ensure the supply is crushed and demand is depleted. We will take all the addicts from the streets and the suppliers will strain to look for a new market,&rdquo; said Marwa.
