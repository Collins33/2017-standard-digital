Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel was last evening freed on bond by a Nanyuki court after spending a night in custody. Mr Lempurkel was released on a Sh200,000 bond by Principal Magistrate Waititu Gichimu, who rejected a plea by the prosecution to detain him for two weeks. The Opposition MP, who has been linked to the ongoing raids on ranches across the vast county, was released following a successful application by Siaya Senator James Orengo. Police indicated Lempurkel was being investigated in connection with the recent murder of a prominent rancher Trinstan Voorpuy of Sosian ranch. The magistrate said he was not satisfied with the argument by the prosecution that the MP would interfere with investigations. &quot;There is no doubt that as an MP, he has great influence but this cannot satisfy the claim that he will interfere with police,&quot; said the magistrate. Mr Gichumi directed the ODM legislator to be reporting to the Laikipia Directorate of Criminal Investigations offices three days a week to assist police in their investigations. &quot;I concur with the defence that from the initial evidence, it is clear the MP was arrested on suspicion of incitement and the charge was not altered in the police Occurrence Book (OB). The case will be mentioned on March 30.
