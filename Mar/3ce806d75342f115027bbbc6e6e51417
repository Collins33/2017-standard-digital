&nbsp; Kenya&#39;s minister of finance will present the government&#39;s budget for the fiscal year of 2017/18 (July-June) in the parliament on March 23, the Treasury said on Tuesday. The East African nation usually presents its budget in June but it has advanced it this year due to a general election scheduled for Aug. 8. Finance Minister Henry Rotich is expected to boost spending, on projected higher revenue, while cutting the fiscal deficit to 7.0 percent of GDP, from 9.6 percent of GDP this fiscal year, the Treasury said last month.
