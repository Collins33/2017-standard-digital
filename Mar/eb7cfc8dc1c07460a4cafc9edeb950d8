Senator Kiraitu Murungi will launch the Meru Youth Service (MYS) if elected governor in August. Friday, Mr Kiraitu said the service will be tasked with carrying out various projects, including planting trees and sinking boreholes. He said MYS would participate in development activities and also address unemployment in the county. &ldquo;Just as there is the national youth service I will also form the MYS.&rdquo; &ldquo;We have many unemployed youths and I want to work with them in road projects because that is one of the challenges in Meru,&rdquo; Kiraitu said, adding that those who scored grade D in Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations formed a big chunk of unemployed youth.
