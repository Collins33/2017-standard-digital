A Member of County Assembly in Nairobi was arrested after violence broke out at a meeting he had convened in Huruma during which one person died. According to police, at least six people were injured in the Sunday night chaos. Ruaraka MCA Peter Owere had organised a meeting in the area that was disrupted by his rival&#39;s supporters leading to violence and chaos. In the ensuing chaos one person was stabbed to death while others were injured, Nairobi police boss Japheth Koome said. The MCA was arrested alongside three other suspects and were expected in court Monday morning to face various charges. The confrontation went on for almost 20 minutes before police arrived to calm the situation. Koome said Owere had&nbsp;not informed them of the planned meeting.

A week ago, another man was killed in Mathare&nbsp;during clashes between supporters of Ruaraka MP Tom Kajwang and Nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro. Dan Onyango, 30, died instantly after being stabbed in the confrontation that occurred March 15 at about 5.30pm. Six others were slightly wounded in the clash that happened as Ms Ongoro met a group of women supporters in the area. Police said a group believed to be supporters of Kajwang stormed the venue prompting the clash. It was then that the death and injuries occurred. Ongoro was quickly whisked away from the scene by her&nbsp;aides. Police said they were investigating the incident and will take action on those arrested over the same. Police fear there would be violence ahead of the August polls and have been mobilising resources to ensure peaceful campaigns.
