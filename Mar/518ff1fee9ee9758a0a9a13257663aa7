Thirteen counties have agreed to work together to improve delivery of health services especially on areas of Malaria and HIV and Aids. The counties forming the Lake Region Economic Bloc (LREB) are in discussion to develop a joint blue print to address challenges in health services. Governors from the counties have now invited President Uhuru&nbsp; Kenyatta to preside over the launch of the new health investment and care system at a ceremony to be held on March 31 at the Kisii University grounds. The function will bring together scholars, leaders of private and Government organisations, multinational corporations and academic disciplines to share knowledge, experiences and research-based evidence. Key to this meeting is the identification of partners who will contribute financial, material and human resources for world class health care facilities in the 13 counties. The counties are Kisii, Bungoma, Kakamega, Trans Nzoia, Vihiga, Migori, Homa Bay, Bomet, Nyamira, Siaya, Kisumu and Kericho.
