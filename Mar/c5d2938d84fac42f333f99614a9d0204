Police are investigating an incident in which a man was killed by a mob after he grabbed money that had allegedly been given out by musician Charles Kanyi aka Jaguar. Kanyi has declared his intention to vie for Starehe parliamentary seat. Police say Jaguar was campaigning in Ziwani on Saturday and gave out some money to a youth group. According to locals and police, a leader of the group grabbed the money and ran away as others pursued him. He was later found dead after being beaten. Nairobi police boss Japheth Koome said they are investigating the incident. Jaguar will face incumbent Maina Kamanda. Others in the race are activist Boniface Mwangi and businessman Steve Mbogo who is seeking ODM ticket. Meanwhile, a suspected thug was on Sunday evening lynched in Buruburu shopping centre, Nairobi, after a failed robbery. Police say a gang of four riding on a motorbike had been terrorising locals when the alarm was raised. The public caught one of them.
