&quot;It is the rains that woke me up, it was dark and I could not tell immediately where I was until a motorcyclist arrived and I waved him to stop,&quot; the victim, Levy Mutinyu told journalists Thursday. The attackers are said to have drugged the teacher and robbed him of Sh31, 000 and a phone and dumped him by the riverside before fleeing. &quot;Part of the money was colleagues&rsquo; contribution towards the burial arrangement of a teacher who passed away and Sh26, 000 was meant for purchase of examination papers,&quot; said Mr Mutinyu. He says, a boda boda operator offered to take him to a friend&#39;s house where he spent the night. &quot;I have reported the matter at Kakamega police station and I am preparing to go to hospital for medical examination because my body aches a lot.&quot; He called on the police to speed up investigations and bring the perpetrators to book.
