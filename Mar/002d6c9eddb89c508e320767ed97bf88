Three Wajir ODM Members of Parliament yesterday led the Degodia community to the Jubilee Party. Adan Keynan Wehliye, Mohamed Ibrahim Elmi and Abass Sheikh Mohamed said the community was tired of being in the Opposition. The leaders, who included 15 Wajir County MCAs led by their speaker Bishar Omar, said their decision to join the ruling party had been informed by the development agenda being implemented by the Government throughout the country. &quot;Your Excellency, you know us, we are always clear on our decisions. When we were joining the Opposition, we declared it in broad daylight. This is the same thing we are doing here,&quot; said Eldas MP Keynan at State House in Nairobi. Speaking during the function, President Uhuru Kenyatta said it had been his desire all along to work with the people of Wajir for the sake of unity and stability of the region. &quot;I am happy with the decision you have made. This has been my prayer since 2013,&quot; said the President.
