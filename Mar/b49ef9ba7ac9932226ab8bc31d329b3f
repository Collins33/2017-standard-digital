A man suspected of killing Laikipia rancher Mr Tristan Voorspuy was Monday arraigned in a Nanyuki court. Samson Lokayi could, however, not take plea after he claimed he could only understand Pokot language. Nanyuki Senior Resident Magistrate Evans Ngige asked the prosecution counsel Cecilia Kinyanjui to find a Pokot interpreter so that the matter could be mentioned today. Lokayi was arrested at the weekend in connection with the fatal shooting of the rancher at his Sosian farm. Lokayi, who appears to be in his early 20s, was not represented. Dressed in a grey short and a dark brown jacket, he looked composed when the magistrate called out his name. Voorspuy was shot and killed a week ago by raiders who had invaded ranches in Laikipia County. Last week, Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel was arraigned in court over the ranch invasions.

The MP was, however, released on a Sh200,000 bond. Mr Voorspuy, a father of two, is an ex-British military officer who had lived in Kenya for many years running a tour company called Offbeat Safaris Limited. After his killing, police officers were deployed at the expansive farm as workers made frantic efforts to move hundreds of cattle out of the ranch.
