Deputy President William Ruto has accused Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto of being an enemy of development. Ruto said the governor&#39;s attempt to stop all projects by the national government in Bomet should be a concern to everyone as the country gears up for the August elections. &quot;Ruto moved to court to jeopardise all development projects the national government tried to roll out in Bomet County. This is unacceptable and he should be held accountable and stopped,&quot; said the DP. He cited construction of a university in Bomet town, which Governor Ruto has fought through court cases. The Deputy President was in Sotik yesterday to commission repayment of dairy farmers who lost their fortunes when the Kenya Cooperative Creameries (KCC) collapsed 20 years ago. He also tore into the governor&#39;s new political outfit, saying it was a ploy to cause division within the Kalenjin community.

He said it was shocking that the governor was running up and down inciting locals against Itare Dam water project. In Eldoret, the DP warned Kalenjin politicians in the North Rift against perpetuating ethnicity for political mileage. &quot;I do not want to hear anybody asking for votes saying he is a Nandi, Marakwet, Keiyo or any other community. I will not allow that and the electorate are at liberty to elect any aspirant they deem fit. As the Kalenjin nation we are one family,&quot; Ruto said.
