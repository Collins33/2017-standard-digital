Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i has taken the role of leading President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election campaign in Gusii region. Dr Matiang&#39;i told public gatherings that he would be jobless after the August elections should the Abagusii community fail to re-elect the President in the August polls. Uhuru is touring the region starting today. The Cabinet secretary was speaking in Nyamira on Sunday when met with county youths. He said Jubilee would form the next Government, adding that his stay as a Cabinet secretary would depend on how the community voted in the August polls. Matiang&#39;i, accompanied by Youth Enterprise Fund Chief Executive Josiah Moriasi, pleaded with the people to vote for Jubilee if they wanted him to continue serving in Government. &quot;What we want to stress to you is that if you don&#39;t vote for Uhuru&#39;s re-election, then it will mean that we also lose our jobs. And the Jubilee government will be in power for the second term, whether you (Gusii electorate) vote for Uhuru or not,&quot; he said, adding that the community needed to speak in one voice during elections if they wanted more gains from the State.

It&#39;s very simple to do that: just wake up on August 8, go and vote for the Opposition. You shall have sent me home by so doing,&quot; Matiang&#39;i told the youths. Matiang&#39;i&#39;s activities in Gusii in the past one month have raised concerns ahead of Uhuru trip to the region. Matiang&#39;i and several Government officials from the region have been traversing the area giving grants worth millions of shillings to schools and raising funds for churches. Matiang&#39;i, Energy CS Charles Keter and Devolution&#39;s Mwangi Kiunjuri recently attended a Sunday service at Kisii Catholic Church, where they each gave personal donations as well as contributions from both President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto. A total of Sh5.7 million was raised.
