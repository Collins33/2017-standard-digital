NYERI, KENYA: Some counties in Mt Kenya region have made good their threats to sack striking doctors. In other counties however the medics started returning to work following a directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta and the council of governors. In Murang&#39;a, the county government has taken radical measures by issuing 45 medical officers with dismissal letters after they failed to return to work by last Friday. And in Kirinyaga all 65 doctors employed by the county were suspended without pay for failing to resume duty. In the Murang&#39;a case, 35 medical officers were expected to get their dismissal letters if they failed to turn up in their work places by close of business. A roll call was conducted by county government officials in charge of health department in all medical facilities. A spot check at Murang&#39;a district hospital revealed that hundreds of patients had thronged to public health facilities in anticipation that the doctors would resume duty. Murang&#39;a county director of medical services Dr Winfred Kanyi said only four doctors were back on duty.
