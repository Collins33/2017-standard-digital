A&nbsp;man&nbsp;behind&nbsp;a&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;for the&nbsp;manual&nbsp;removal&nbsp;of&nbsp;water&nbsp;hyacinth&nbsp;from&nbsp;Lake&nbsp;Victoria&nbsp;was&nbsp;Monday&nbsp;attacked&nbsp;and&nbsp;thrown&nbsp;into the&nbsp;lake&nbsp;over&nbsp;claims&nbsp;he&nbsp;swindled&nbsp;members&nbsp;of&nbsp;his&nbsp;former&nbsp;organisation. Benard Odinga, the director of an&nbsp;organisation&nbsp;called Agulu Environmental Network, found himself in trouble when residents found him trying to engage another group to&nbsp;remove&nbsp;the weed. The angry residents accused Odinga&nbsp;swindling&nbsp;them during the first phase of the project before it collapsed. Drama started when locals spotted him at Lwangni Beach in the company of a group of women whom&nbsp;he&nbsp;had reportedly hired to&nbsp;remove&nbsp;the weed. They followed him to Kichinjio Beach where they demanded that&nbsp;he&nbsp;pays them for work they did five years ago. The youths&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;they had paid Sh500 to register with the&nbsp;organisation. They had been promised Sh600 per day.
