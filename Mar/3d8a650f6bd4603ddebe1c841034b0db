Pupils in Teso South constituency, Busia County are increasingly dropping out of school due to jigger infestation menace. Over 30 homes in the village of Angorom have been severely affected. Laurence Omerekek family has been hit hard after his eight children opted to quit school due to the jiggers. The children are said to have dropped out of school because of shame and stigma associated with jiggers as they were being ridiculed. Mr Omerekek is now appealing for help that will see his children healed to continue with education. &quot;We have always been treating them, they get healed then after sometimes they resurface. It has made it hard for my children to go to school,&quot; Omerekek. &quot;I am concerned about the education of my children and that is why am appealing for medical assistance,&quot; he added.

Residents are now calling on the county government through its ministry of health to work with other entities to eradicate jiggers in Angorom. &quot;Even if we treat them now, they will be healed but because of the poor environment they are living in, jiggers will still resurface,&quot; said Apadet.
