Former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth has been proposed as the running mate for Deputy President William Ruto during the 2022 General Election. Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata said if the former MP and assistant minister will be on the ballot alongside Ruto for presidency, the pair was likely to get support in the entire country. Mr Kang&rsquo;ata disclosed that Murang&rsquo;a County was prepared to support Kenneth to be the deputy president owing to his vast experience and ability to transform the country. &ldquo;Right after President Uhuru Kenyatta, we shall support Ruto for the presidency and Kenneth as his deputy, which is already a concluded matter,&rdquo; said Kang&rsquo;ata. He spoke during Murang&rsquo;a County Education Day at Murang&rsquo;a Teachers College where Information Communication and Technology (ICT) Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru was the chief guest. Kenneth is one of the Jubilee Party aspirants looking to unseat Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero. He is likely to face Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko in the contention for the Jubilee Party ticket.

Leaders present during the Education Day included Senate Deputy Speaker Kembi Gitura and Mathioya MP Clement Wambugu. They urged all Kenyans to support the Jubilee government and ensure Kenyatta is re-elected. Kembi said since the mass voter registration was now over, Jubilee leaders must use all available forums to campaign for re-election of Uhuru&rsquo;s administration. &ldquo;With additional 110,000 new voters, Murang&rsquo;a should give Kenyatta 700,000-plus votes during the 2017 General Election,&rdquo; said Kembi as he lauded all those who made the mass voter registration exercise a success.
