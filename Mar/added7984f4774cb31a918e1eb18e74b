The widow of Peter Kigathi, the immediate former Majimazuri/Mumberes ward representative in Baringo County, has emerged the winner of the by-election. Susan Wacuka won after garnering 2,106 votes against Narc candidate Eliud Kamau, who bagged 313 votes. Returning officer Vincent Kimeli said only 34.1 per cent of the 7,079 registered voters turned out to vote in the 19 polling stations. Ms Wacuka, who came second in the Jubilee primaries, was handed the ticket after the party learnt that the winner was not a registered voter. The electoral commission could not clear Cornelius Cheruiyot as he was ineligible to participate in the mini poll.
