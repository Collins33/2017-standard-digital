Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale has asked the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to carry out lifestyle audits of the top Jubilee leadership. While lauding the anti-graft agency for announcing plans to lock out county bosses who have been implicated in corruption from vying in the August General Election, Khalwale said investigations should be extended to Jubilee leaders as well. Speaking in Kakamega yesterday, Khalwale said there was a need for Deputy President William Ruto, in particular, to undergo a thorough lifestyle audit. He questioned the source of the Deputy President&#39;s wealth. &quot;Do not stop at governors alone. Go beyond and investigate the Deputy President to know the exact source of his wealth because he has persistently said in public that was he a mere chicken seller but he is now a billionaire,&quot; said Khalwale. County assembly officials implicated in corruption may not be spared either as EACC has said it will also bar them from vying for elective seats in the August 8 polls.
