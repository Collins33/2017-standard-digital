A 41-year-old man was struck by lightning at Kabong&#39;o village in Kajwang&#39;, Ndhiwa sub-county, on Wednesday. &nbsp;Businessman Charles Onyango was returning from visiting a friend when he was killed. A resident found Onyango&#39;s body along a footpath yesterday morning. &quot;His friend asked him to stay until the rain subsided but he was in a hurry and left,&quot; said Goyo Assistant Chief Tom Rapada. The chief said cases of lighting striking people are common in the area. Late last year, a woman was killed by lightning. County police boss John Omusanga said the body had severe burns.
