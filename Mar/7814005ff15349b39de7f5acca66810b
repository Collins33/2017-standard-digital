Unfortunately, not even the death of Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua has mellowed Members of the County Assembly who, until his death, were a thorn in his flesh. They did everything possible to hinder the governor from executing his mandate and even in death, they declared that they would boycott his funeral. That signifies a deep-rooted problem. It seems MCAs have over-rated their role in the management of counties. Project identification and implementation is a collective, consultative process that takes on board all stakeholders in line with constitutional requirements and separation of powers. MCAs cannot therefore turn around and refuse to pass a county budget using the lame excuse that they do not know its contents. In any case, projects aim to benefit residents and unless there are clear cases of violation of say, procurement rules, MCAs should not be seen to act as impediments to development on account of political differences. Nyeri County MCAs owe it to the people of Nyeri to heed the advice of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga, who urged them not to impede the work of governors. In the remaining few months, the new governor, Samuel Wamathai, needs support, not distractions and unnecessary sideshows.
