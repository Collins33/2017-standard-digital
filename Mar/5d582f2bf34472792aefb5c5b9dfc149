Governor Isaac Ruto says his party, Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM), is aiming to register at least 200,000 members. He said he would make sure Jubilee Party was not supported in the county ahead of the August elections. &quot;CCM has already registered 100,000 members over the last one month and we will ensure that our party is the dominant one here,&quot; said the governor as Jubilee began registering members in the region. National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso, who spoke in Bomet town on Sunday, said Jubilee only suspended membership registration last month to focus on the registration of voters. The governor has launched a campaign to fight Jubilee, which he accuses of failing residents.
