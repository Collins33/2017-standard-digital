Jubilee Party parliamentary aspirant&nbsp;Kalembe Ndile says his life is in danger following a number of attacks. He now wants the police to provide him with adequate security. Addressing journalists at Mlolongo Police Station shortly after he recorded a statement, Mr Ndile said the latest attack occurred at his Mlolongo home yesterday morning. The former Kibwezi MP, who is now aspiring for the Mavoko parliamentary seat, said almost 20 men forced their way into his compound in three vehicles. &quot;I read mischief in the whole thing. This is the third time I am being targeted,&quot; he said. Last month, a gang of more than 10 attempted to jump over the perimeter wall of his compound.
