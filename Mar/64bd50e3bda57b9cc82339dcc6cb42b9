Kenya&#39;s first Education Cabinet minister Joseph Otiende was on Saturday laid to rest in a solemn ceremony that was attended by senior politicians. Opposition leaders led by NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang&#39;ula eulogised Otiende as a pragmatic leader who fronted key reforms in education and health sectors. &quot;Otiende set up the health and education infrastructures and brought these services closer to our people through his innovative campaigns and advocacies. His handling of these key dockets at Kenya&#39;s formative years gave the nation an edge that it enjoys to date,&#39;&#39; Mudavadi said during the requiem mass at Kegoye Secondary School in Vihiga County. In a speech read on his behalf by County Commissioner Pauline Dola, President Uhuru Kenyatta said Otiende was a great son of Kenya who leaves an indelible mark. Mudavadi described Kenya&#39;s pioneer education minister as a diligent elder whose advisory services were sought after widely. &quot;He is the hero of Kenya&#39;s independent cabinet who set the pace for Kenya&#39;s education system. With his passing, Kenya has lost part of its living history,&quot; Mudavadi said.
