Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto has defended 10 senior county officials facing charges of fraud. &nbsp;Ruto told a Nyamira court the officers have worked diligently and did not commit the offences they are accused of. The offence was allegedly committed during renovation of Mr Ruto&#39;s official residence before 2013. &quot;My officers had little to do with the plan of its execution as this was the work of the defunct Transitional Authority,&quot; said the governor. &quot;I was not even briefed on the alleged irregularities. I only came to learn about it later.&quot; Ruto was the sixth witness.
