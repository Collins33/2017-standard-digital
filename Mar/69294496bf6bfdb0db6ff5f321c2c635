A section of Murang&#39;a County leaders want governors who have been linked to corruption to be sued. Lawmakers Jamleck Kamau (Kigumo), Kamande Mwangi (Maragua) and Deputy Governor Gakure Monyo said all leaders should be held accountable for funds misappropriated during their tenure. &nbsp;Kamau, who is vying for the gubernatorial seat, said current governors cannot be trusted since they &quot;only want re-election to safeguard their loot&quot;. Speaking during rallies in the region, Kamau said he would recover any stolen public funds if elected governor. He was accompanied by Mwangi and Monyo. -Allan Mungai
