There are 10,000 licensed firearm holders in the country. Authorities are in the process of implementing various reforms aimed at addressing the misuse of licensed guns. The Firearms Licensing Board has been cancelling permits issued to those who have misused their weapons. Before one is allowed to own a gun, he is required to apply through an OCS, who forwards the application to the OCPD who then convenes a meeting of the district intelligence and security officers for review before it is sent to the county commanders for approval.
