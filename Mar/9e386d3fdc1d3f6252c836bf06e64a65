Nairobi gubernatorial aspirant Peter Kenneth has said he is confident of a landslide victory in the Jubilee Party primaries and later against incumbent Governor Evans Kidero. This comes a day after Deputy President William Ruto&#39;s March 4 deadline for the party&#39;s Nairobi aspirants to front a single candidate through consensus elapsed. The Jubilee Party nominations deadline was, however, extended to Friday. Speaking at St John ACK Church in Pumwani, Kenneth said he was not afraid of competitive party primaries because he was sure he would edge out &quot;Team Nairobi&quot; currently led by Senator Mike Sonko. &quot;We are ready for nominations so that we can sort out this issue of Nairobi once and for all. I am working with a big team and I am confident that we will win the nominations and go ahead to deal with Odhiambo Kidero,&quot; said Kenneth. He said Sonko, former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru, Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru, and TNA nominated MP Johnson Sakaja lacked the capacity to serve Nairobians and that he was the best placed candidate to unseat Kidero. Kenneth further hinted at having a woman as his running mate, saying he had considered Linette Mirehare, a former councillor in the city.
