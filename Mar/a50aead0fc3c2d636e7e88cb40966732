The National Super Alliance (NASA) will tame the national debt burden presided over by the Jubilee administration if it wins the presidential election on August 8, Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi has said. Mudavadi, who is on a two-day political tour of Narok, said it was despicable that the Jubilee administration within four years tripled what retired President Mwai Kibaki borrowed in 10 years he was in power. He said the huge borrowing was interfering with the national budget and might lead to an increase in taxation of the already &quot;pressed&quot; taxpayers. &quot;These two Jubilee leaders have borrowed huge amounts of money and as a former Finance Minister, I will tame this should I ascend to power,&quot; said Mudavadi. He urged Narok residents to question when Jubilee leaders tell them that &#39;Tuko Pamoja&#39; (we are together), saying they could be meaning exactly the opposite. He asked the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to preside over internationally accepted elections.

We want democracy to thrive and that can only happen should IEBC deliver credible elections that will be acceptable to Kenyans and the world,&quot; said the ANC leader. He said he deserves to be the NASA presidential candidate, being the founder of the alliance and given his experience in government. He however reiterated that he was ready to accept whoever clinches the position for the sake of the unity. &quot;We are in the process of identifying the NASA presidential candidate and among us and we shall all support whoever wins. We shall remain one but as the NASA founder, pray for me,&quot; he told the locals. Mudavadi will battle it out with other NASA co-principals Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&#39;ula for the Opposition ticket.
