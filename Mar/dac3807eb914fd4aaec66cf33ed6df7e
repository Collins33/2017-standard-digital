NASA leader Raila Odinga was Wednesday treated at the Karen Hospital for food poisoning. Raila was taken to the hospital after he complained of stomach ache. He was supposed to be in his office for a series of meetings. He was treated and discharged from the hospital with some of his handlers saying he is expected to fly to South Africa Thursday to visit his daughter Rosemary. His spokesman Dennis Onyango confirmed the treatment and discharge of the Opposition chief without giving details. Raila has been busy in the past weeks crisscrossing many parts of the country. He also visited Nigeria before he flew back on Sunday and flew to Nyeri for the burial of former Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagwa. Rosemary is recuperating in South Africa after an operation in Kenya. She is in the company of her mother Ida Odinga and sister Winnie Odinga. ALSO READ: Women leaders back Raila Odinga for top seat
