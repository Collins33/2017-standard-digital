Opposition leaders have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to swallow his pride and allow them help end the ongoing doctors&#39; strike. Speaking in separate functions MPs Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja), Jakoyo Midiwo (Gem) and Omondi Muluan (Alego Usonga) argued that it was a shame that the national government could not handle the ongoing strike. They said it is irresponsible for the Government to call for the intervention of the Church after failing to come up with a breakthrough for three months. &quot;It is the height of abdication of responsibility for national government to call for the intervention of the church. President Uhuru Kenyatta must step up his responsibility and look up to issues affecting the people. Three months doctors strike is something that has never happened anywhere in the world and there is no meaningful breakthrough on sight,&quot; said Wandayi. &quot;If Uhuru gathers the courage to ask for the intervention of opposition leaders it will not take more than two hours to bring the strike to an end. The opposition is really ready to intervene, we are just waiting for an invitation,&quot; he added. Doctors who have been on strike for 90 days now are demanding implementation of the 2013 CBA which includes a 300 percent salary increment.

I am glad we are headed for an election where the people will send him home,&quot; he said.
