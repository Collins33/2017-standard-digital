Siaya Senator James Orengo has denied claims by National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale that a top Opposition leader has been involved in repeated attempts to hack the electoral agency&#39;s database. The senator instead dared Mr Duale to come clean and mention the leader instead of trying to confuse Kenyans. Speaking in Rarieda, Mr Orengo said the national government had the machinery to determine whoever could be involved. The senator was reacting to a statement by Duale claiming that a top leader in the National Super Alliance (NASA) was planning to hack the database of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). Duale further claimed the noise about rigging the August elections by NASA leaders was meant to divert attention.
