Interesting&nbsp;events&nbsp;characterise&nbsp;live&nbsp;current&nbsp;affairs&nbsp;talk&nbsp;shows&nbsp;in&nbsp;radio&nbsp;and&nbsp;television&nbsp;stations.&nbsp;Serious&nbsp;challenges&nbsp;await&nbsp;the&nbsp;media&nbsp;this&nbsp;election&nbsp;year&nbsp;if&nbsp;what&nbsp;happened&nbsp;on&nbsp;March&nbsp;19,&nbsp;2017&nbsp;on&nbsp;Radio Maisha&nbsp;and&nbsp;Citizen&nbsp;TV&nbsp;is&nbsp;anything&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;by. Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria walked out of a&nbsp;live&nbsp;radio&nbsp;discussion while Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko became rowdy while being interviewed at prime time on&nbsp;Citizen&nbsp;TV. While Kuria stormed out when asked a question he deemed irritating for whatever reason (and it&rsquo;s not the first time he walked out of a&nbsp;live&nbsp;show), Sonko was disorderly and could not engage in a sober discussion. In addition to his wanting behaviour, he insulted people who were not participating in the interview and harassed the host, Mr Hussein Mohammed. These isolated incidents raise the red flag on how&nbsp;live&nbsp;studio interviews are likely to be problematic this electioneering period. The&nbsp;media&nbsp;must guard against being used as an avenue for politicians to trade barbs. The&nbsp;media&nbsp;must resist being drawn into other people&rsquo;s wars. For the record, journalists are not contestants but recorders of&nbsp;events. Actually, the programme code for free to&nbsp;air&nbsp;broadcasters has advised against instantaneous&nbsp;live&nbsp;broadcasting, insisting broadcasts be delayed by at least seven seconds before&nbsp;going&nbsp;on&nbsp;air&nbsp;to guard against such cases. Journalists and by extension,&nbsp;media&nbsp;houses, must be strict on not only choosing who to invite for&nbsp;live&nbsp;shows, but more on the safety of their staff. Effort should also be made to ensure there is adequate preparation between the host and the interviewee before the&nbsp;airing&nbsp;of programmes. The progamme host has a responsibility to obtain sufficient briefing and background information on the subject. We must maintain sanity and good conduct. Otherwise, the language and behavior of some guests is regrettable. While the&nbsp;media&nbsp;should not hold brief for those without manners and decorum, sources who lack manners should not be allowed into studios in the first place. The aim of an interview or discussion programme is to have the interviewee/guest provide facts, reasons or opinions on a particular topic, which is expected to help the listener to make conclusions on the validity of&nbsp;what&nbsp;he or she is saying. There have been cases where in addition to being drunk and poorly prepared for&nbsp;live&nbsp;shows, some guests have turned up in studios while armed. Some cases have been reported where guests physically fought in the studio during programmes.

The role of the&nbsp;media&nbsp;in an&nbsp;election&nbsp;is to ensure the&nbsp;citizen&nbsp;is empowered to make an informed choice. The&nbsp;media, therefore, have a duty to provide coverage that gives the&nbsp;citizen&nbsp;sufficient, accurate and reliable information on electoral matters. The&nbsp;media&nbsp;have a duty to debunk myths, stereotypes and counter fake news. Media&nbsp;houses should demonstrate that the main parties or candidates vying for office are given equal opportunities to be heard or questioned and, that minor parties or candidates are not treated unfairly. Fair and balanced coverage also means that individual stories, and their pattern over a period of time, reflect the reality as well as the views of different parties or candidates. In an&nbsp;election&nbsp;year, the&nbsp;media&nbsp;is duty-bound to foster stability by reducing conflict and polarisation. The Fourth Estate should promote the rule of law and the proper functioning of institutions. &mdash;The writer works at the&nbsp;Media&nbsp;Council of Kenya as the Programmes Manager and a Journalists Safety Trainer.
