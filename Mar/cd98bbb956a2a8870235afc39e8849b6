Embattled Tiaty Member of Parliament Asman Kamama has defected from Jubilee Party and joined Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua&rsquo;s Maendeleo Chap Chap (MCC). He joins a team of politicians who have recently joined MCC, including former Imenti Central MP Gitobu Imanyara who crossed over from the Orange Democratic Movement. Kamama&rsquo;s move comes at a time when he is facing backlash in Parliament over bandit attacks and cattle rustling in Kerio Valley, Baringo and environs. He had recently indicated that he would quit being Chairman of the parliamentary Security Committee following pressure to do so in order to pave way for investigation into insecurity in his region.&nbsp;
