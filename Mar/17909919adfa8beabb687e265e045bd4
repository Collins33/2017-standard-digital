Nairobi, Kenya:&nbsp; Nestl&eacute; Kenya has launched a new reformulated NESCAF&Eacute;&reg; 3in1 giving the product a creamier taste in a move to tap into the increased coffee consumption by youth and the emerging urbanised middle class in the country. &nbsp;NESCAF&Eacute;&reg;, the world&rsquo;s first instant coffee and the fifth most valuable food and drink brand has been at the forefront in encouraging Kenyans to drink their own coffee for the last 50 years. Recently Nestl&eacute; unveiled the brand&rsquo;s new slogan &ldquo;It all starts with a NESCAF&Eacute;&reg;&rdquo; which has further helped in popularizing coffee drinking habit among the young people in Kenya and beyond. Globally over 5,500 cups of NESCAF&Eacute;, are drunk each second while in Kenya the brand is one of the most popular and iconic coffee brands. Speaking when she unveiled the new NESCAF&Eacute;&reg;,&nbsp; 3in1, the Nestl&eacute; East Africa Cluster Manager Managing Director, Ms. Ciru Miring&rsquo;u said the consumption for coffee in Kenya has increased tremendously with Nairobi alone now hosting ten times more coffee bars than it did 5 years ago. &ldquo;80 per cent of the coffee consumed in Kenya is instant and this is what has helped catapult coffee drinking which was lastly reported to have jumped by 46 per cent between 2010 and 2014,&rdquo; said Ms. Miring&rsquo;u ALSO READ: Coffee regulators issue measures to curb rampant coffee theft The new instant NESCAF&Eacute;&reg; 3in1 is suited to the Kenyan palate which gives it an enhanced taste. Nestl&eacute; hopes that this will help the NESCAF&Eacute;&reg; brand to further penetrate the coffee market. &ldquo;We have also maintained the smaller packaging for the NESCAF&Eacute;&reg; 3in1 to ensure that more Kenyans have access to the product. This is in line with our commitment to serve all the emerging coffee drinkers as the 18g sachet will ensure every Kenyan can access the product at a smaller quantity and at an affordable price,&rdquo; said Ms. Miring&rsquo;u. In order to ensure there is consistency in the supply of quality coffee beans in Kenya, Nestl&eacute; launched its NESCAF&Eacute;&reg; Plan&nbsp; programme in 2011 and has since spent over Sh71 million shillings in providing technical support and training to farmers. The programme currently supports over 41000 coffee farmers in 12 Farmers Cooperative Societies in Eastern and Central Kenya. &nbsp;&ldquo;We have in the past 50 years bought coffee beans from Kenya. As the demand for coffee grows so is the need to enhance its supply hence the reason why we have to consistently ensure the sustainability of coffee supply as the NESCAF&Eacute;&reg; brand demand continues to rise,&rdquo; said Ms. Miring&rsquo;u. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuLQW_pxcRk&amp;feature=youtu.be The growing demand of the NESCAF&Eacute;&reg; brand and overall popularity of coffee drinking in Kenya can also be attributed to the phenomenal success of the Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s MYOWBU (MY OWN BUSINESS) programme where the number of youths engaging in selling Nescaf&eacute; on the move has grown from less than 100 in 2014 to more than 400 in 2016. Nestl&eacute; works with university students, women and youths who sell the hot beverage in busy public areas such as open markets, stadiums and bus stops. &ldquo;Today the MYOWBU programme is hugely successful with vendors earning between Sh400 to 2000 per day. The vendors undergo intensive hygiene, book keeping and basic financial training. After training each new vendor is given a kit comprising a coffee dispenser, NESCAF&Eacute;&reg; products, hot water flasks, disposable cups among others. Thereafter, they are able to purchase new stocks from nearby shops,&rdquo; said Ms. Miring&rsquo;u.
