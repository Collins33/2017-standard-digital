Over 200 Bukusu elders have endorsed Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba for re-election. &nbsp;Speaking during a meeting held at Bishop Muge Conference, the elders led by Ferdinand Wanyisia said they had resolved to back the governor, owing to his impressive development record. The elders asked other gubernatorial aspirants from the Bukusu community to shelve their ambitions until 2022. &nbsp;But in a quick rejoinder, Khaemba&rsquo;s rivals Maurice Bisau, Andrew Wanyonyi and Moses Khaoya dismissed the endorsement. &ldquo;These elders purporting to represent the community have no mandate to ask us to drop our bids. Wanyisia is serving at the governor&rsquo;s office and he is trying to defend the status quo and this is not going to work. His boss is on his way out,&rdquo; said Bisau. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Uhuru shifts blame to Raila over 2008 post-poll killings and chaos
