The Constitution 2010 created two tiers of government that came into effect after the March 2013 General Election. The advent of devolution, therefore, demanded that some administrative functions and assets be moved from the national to the county governments. Under the Transition to Devolved Government Act 2012, the Transitional Authority (TA) was created and began work that constitutionally had to come to a close in March 2016. However, by that date, TA had done little to complete its work. Attempts to extend TA&rsquo;s life failed and its outstanding work was passed to the Inter-Governmental Relations Technical Committee. Former TA chairman Kinuthia Wamwangi failed to accomplish his mission in the time frame allotted and should not now regale the public with what will happen to assets formerly owned by local authorities that are now in danger of being illegally appropriated by county officials. Such claims vindicate complaints by governors that TA was ineffective in ensuring the smooth transfer of functions and assets to county governments. The information on assets in Wamwangi&rsquo;s possession should be passed to the relevant authorities for appropriate action to be taken. ALSO READ: Kenyan journalists gear up for polls duty
