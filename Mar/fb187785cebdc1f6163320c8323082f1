Rigathi Gachagua, the brother of former Governor Nderitu Gachagua, has dropped out of the race for the governorship. Mr Rigathi said he had been under pressure to abandon the parliamentary race for the governorship after his brother&#39;s death. &ldquo;I have received delegations from the six sub counties asking me to go for the governor&#39;s position, it was a difficult time for me as I was torn as to what I should do,&rdquo; Rigathi said. He will vie for the Mathira parliamentary seat instead. &quot;For the sake of the people of Mathira I will do my best to change the lives of residents as an MP, &quot;he said. He said that even though he respected the sitting MP Peter Weru, seven out of ten people did not know their legislator.

Nyeri Senator Mutahi Kagwe and Governor Samuel Wamaathai who were close to the late governor are among those in the gubernatorial race. &quot;The two, senator and deputy governor were very close to us. Senator Kagwe is a personal friend, loyal supporter of the governor, sacrificed a lot for the governor. Wamathai has been a loyal deputy who did not let ambition get in the way,&rdquo; he said.
