Jubilee leaders from the Mount Kenya region have cautioned residents against voting for the National Super Alliance (NASA) in the August 8 General Election. Led by Senate Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki and Chuka Igambang&#39;ombe MP Muthomi Njuki, the leaders said the region was experiencing growth as a result of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto. &nbsp;NASA leaders had not done anything for the region from their days in government and should not dupe residents they will bring development, said Professor Kindiki, the Tharaka Nithi Senator. Speaking when Mr Njuki launched his gubernatorial bid by unveiling his manifesto at Marimanti in Tharaka Nithi, an event also attended by MPs Moses Kuria, (Gatundu South), Kamu Ichung&#39;wa (Kikuyu), Mburi Muiru (Tharaka), Beatrice Nkatha (Tharaka Nithi Woman rep) and Muriuki Ngagagua (Mbeere North), Senator Kindiki said NASA should not waste their time campaigning in the region. &quot;We and residents here only recognize President Uhuru&#39;s Jubilee Party. Jubilee is an organized outfit that has a clear agenda and its leaders. We are like an army and are led by Uhuru, unlike a rudderless NASA who are yet to decide who, among Kalonzo, Wetang&#39;ula, Mudavadi and Raila, is their presidential candidate,&quot; said Kindiki. Kindiki also downplayed the presence of Party of National Unity, Maendeleo Chap Chap and other parties in the region.

Others are wasting their time,&quot; Kindiki said who also announced President Kenyatta would visit the county this week. Kindiki appealed to residents to vote for Jubilee candidates in August. &nbsp;&quot;We want Jubilee to have enough senators and MPs in National Assembly and Senate, so that government bills and other projects are not blocked by the opposition MPs. We also want Jubilee governors and MCAs so that counties are able to propel the Jubilee agenda,&quot; he said. Mr Njuki who said his priorities as governors include provision of water to attain food security and infrastructural development, said Uhuru&#39;s administration had done well, and needed another term to advance its agenda. &nbsp;&quot;The larger Meru is for the Jubilee government&#39;s re-election because it has good plans for this area. We have partnered in development and want it to continue,&quot; Njuki who also named former Tharaka MP Francis Kagwima as his potential running mate, said. &nbsp;Mr Kuria and Ichung&#39;wa said because of Jubilee, thousands of kilometres of tarmac had been built. &nbsp;Kuria predicted a fallout in NASA.

But there is improved trade now because we have tarmac in Tharaka, Chuka and Maara,&quot; Kuria said.
