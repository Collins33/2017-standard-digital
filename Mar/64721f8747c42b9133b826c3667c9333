(Photos: Peter Muthomi/Standard) Former North Imenti MP Silas Muriuki has appealed to Meru Governor Peter Munya not to field a candidate from Party of National Unity, in the parliamentary race. Muriuki, a key Munya ally, defected from the Jubilee Party to Mazingira Party where he has a direct ticket to vie for the seat. Speaking when he accompanied the Governor to open the Runogone Dispensary on Friday, Muriuki said he did not wish to antagonise either Munya or President Uhuru Kenyatta, hence his decision to move out to Mazingira. &quot;I have just completed my term as board chairman of the Local Authorities Provident Fund courtesy of President Uhuru, and as chairman of the Meru town development board courtesy of Governor Munya. People expected me to go to PNU but just as Uhuru has Jubilee and Munya has PNU I also have a home called Mazingira,&quot; Muriuki said. Other candidates who have expressed interest in the North Imenti MP seat are former Interior PS Mutea Iringo and Ken Muriuki. ALSO READ: Plan to deny governors visa benefits opposed
