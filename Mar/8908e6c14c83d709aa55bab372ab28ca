The world marked the International Women&rsquo;s Day Wednesday. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres graced the celebrations in Nairobi and pointed out that male chauvinism was the greatest obstacle to gender parity. The 11th Parliament, which is dominated by men, has twice failed to pass a Bill that would have ensured the two-thirds gender representation rule was actualised. In recognition of the women&rsquo;s contribution to society&rsquo;s development, the Government has declared zero tolerance to violence against women, but the reality on the ground is different. The statics are worrisome. A 2014 survey shows 47 per cent of women between 15 and 49 years have experienced physical and sexual violence. The report goes on to reveal that 39 per cent of women in the same age bracket and in marriage have experienced physical and sexual violence. In this age, these are shameful acts that demand every possible thing is done to accord women their rights and the decency they deserve. Men must be in the forefront championing this noble initiative.
