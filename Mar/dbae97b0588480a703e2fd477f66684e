&nbsp;Police officers have been ordered to shoot those causing trouble at the volatile Trans Mara-Kisii border on sight. &nbsp;&quot;The cat and mouse game between the police and criminals must end now. These criminals should be shot on sight as they are a threat to the country&#39;s security,&quot; County Commissioner Moffatt Kangi said. He said security officers are planning a mop-up to curb tribal clashes. Kangi also gave residents 14 days to surrender illegal firearms. Kangi, who is also the chairman of the County Security and Integration Committee, issued a shoot-to-kill order against civilians spotted with illegal firearms. Kangi termed runaway cattle theft and boundary disputes that have left many people dead and several houses torched in areas such as Esoit Naibor, Kirindon and Pimpiniet unacceptable. The administrator, who was addressing locals during a peace and reconciliation meeting between members of the Kipsigis and Maasai communities at Esoit trading centre, directed the police to hunt down those who are armed.
