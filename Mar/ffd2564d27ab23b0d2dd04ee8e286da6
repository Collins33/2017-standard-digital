All university academic staff members will enjoy a house allowance of 3.9 per cent. Assistant lecturers will earn a flat rate of Sh51,061 a month as professors take home Sh73,715. It also means that all university academic staff members will enjoy a salary increase of 17.5 per cent. &quot;Payment of eligible academic members of staff shall be effected in full on a date not later than June 30, 2017,&quot; reads the return-to-work formula signed by the unions and university managements.

Universities Academic Staff Union (Uasu)&nbsp;Secretary-General Constantine Wasonga yesterday said the deal was the best under the circumstances. &quot;We were running out of time because we should start talks for the 2017-2021 CBA and they had agreed to harmonise the salaries for all workers. It is a good deal,&quot; said Wasonga. The details emerged a day after Uasu signed a Sh6 billion collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with public universities. However, the workers of Maasai Mara University will only receive a salary increase of 12.9 per cent because their salaries were higher than those of their colleagues in other universities. Maasai Mara staff will also not get an increase in house allowance because their rates are higher.
