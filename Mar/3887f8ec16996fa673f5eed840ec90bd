Jubilee Party has suffered a blow in Kakamega after its two keys allies defecting to Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). Former ODM youth leader Rashid Mohammed and former Shinyalu MP Justus Kizito have ditched the ruling party for ODM. Both Rashid and Kizito once were members of ODM. Rashid confirmed a meeting with ODM leader Raila Odinga and his deputy Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya which influenced the decision to rejoin the Orange party. &quot;ODM has reached to a number of key leaders in the county in their quest to have them work with them ahead of this year&#39;s elections. There has been a meeting with ODM top leaders and believe me Jubilee has suffered the loss in the county,&quot; said Rashid. Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali who is Jubilee point man in the county said he heard rumor of Kizito quitting the party but he is yet to confirm it.
