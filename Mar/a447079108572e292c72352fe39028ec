Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi has castigated Governor Peter Munya for alleged embezzlement of funds meant for development. The senator, who is seeking to unseat Munya, alleged misuse of Sh31 billion by the county government in the last four years. He was speaking at a hotel in Nakuru where he attended Meru head teachers&rsquo; conference. Kiraitu said Munya&#39;s poor relationship with national government education officials had negatively impacted on the county&#39;s education sector. &quot;It is embarrassing that no student in Meru scored a straight A in last year&#39;s KCSE. But given the opportunity, I will develop practical strategies for radical improvement of our performance and national examinations,&quot; he said.
