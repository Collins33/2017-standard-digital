BUNGOMA, KENYA: Governor Ken Lusaka has urged his officers to serve the people of Bungoma with diligence, and stop engaging in corruption. The Governor said it was discouraging for some officers to take an oath only for them to steal public money a few months later in office. &quot;When you fail to serve the public, you&#39;re cursing your children. And any officer engaging in dirty deals will carry his or her own cross,&quot; said the Governor. He said this on Friday during the swearing in of Aruput Isaac Juma as the Chief Officer for Livestock &amp; Fisheries. He replaces Jacob Okisegere, who passed on in 2015. Deputy Governor Hillary Chongwony observed that the county government had made great strides in turning around the fortunes of Bungoma, ranging from roads, agriculture, education, health, among others.

This is a turning point in my life. I thank Governor Lusaka and the county for identifying me for this job.
