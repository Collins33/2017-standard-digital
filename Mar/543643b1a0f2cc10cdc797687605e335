Embu politicians allied to Jubilee Party have urged Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka to join the Government side to safeguard his political future. Led by Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire, they warned Kalonzo that he risked sinking into political oblivion if he spent another five years in the Opposition. Ms Mbarire said it was obvious that the flag bearer for the National Super Alliance (NASA) would be Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga and therefore it was a waste of time for Kalonzo to give ultimatums to be named the NASA presidential candidate. The MP said Kalonzo had what it takes to be a national leader. County Assembly Speaker Kariuki Mate said Kalonzo was wasting his time in the Opposition as he could have joined President Uhuru Kenyatta to enjoy the trappings of power long before his tribulations began. Mr Mate said it was embarrassing for a former vice president to appear like a beggar in the Opposition when he had spent the better part of his political career in the Government.
