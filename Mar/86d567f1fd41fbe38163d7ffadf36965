There is&nbsp;panic&nbsp;in the&nbsp;killing&nbsp;fields&nbsp;of&nbsp;Baringo,&nbsp;Laikipia&nbsp;and&nbsp;Marakwet,&nbsp;despite&nbsp;repeated&nbsp;assurances&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;government&nbsp;that&nbsp;bandits&nbsp;will be&nbsp;decimated&nbsp;by the&nbsp;rapid&nbsp;response&nbsp;force&nbsp;deployed&nbsp;in the&nbsp;region&nbsp;a&nbsp;fortnight&nbsp;ago. Gunfire&nbsp;from&nbsp;bandits&nbsp;has increased, families have fled their homes in droves, schools have been closed in&nbsp;Baringo&nbsp;and ranchers are a worried lot after one was shot dead last week in&nbsp;Laikipia. Rift Valley&nbsp;Regional&nbsp;Commissioner Wanyama Musiambo and his security team are spending sleepless nights dealing with the marauding&nbsp;bandits&nbsp;as the situation escalates. He has declared the affected areas &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; and that means police officers and police reservists can apply&nbsp;force&nbsp;to ensure there is law and order. &ldquo;The declaration that those places are dangerous means people in those areas cannot enjoy certain liberties but it is not a declaration of an emergency,&rdquo; said Mwenda Njoka, a Communications Director in the Ministry of Interior. Last week, The Standard on Sunday visited the area where herdsmen armed with AK47 rifles could be seen roaming in the shrub lands of Kerio Valley all the way&nbsp;from&nbsp;Tiaty in&nbsp;Baringo, Sigor to Turkwel in West Pokot and across the River Wei Wei in Turkana South.

He spoke when he commissioned the police reservists to join the security operation as questions about their&nbsp;deployment&nbsp;were raised by a section of leaders and human rights activists. But in a show of might and contempt on the ongoing joint security operation, the&nbsp;bandits&nbsp;killed&nbsp;11 people at Mukutani in&nbsp;Baringo&nbsp;South on Tuesday night. Another group of the daring&nbsp;bandits&nbsp;suspected to have come&nbsp;from&nbsp;Turkana South snuffed out two lives early this week at Lami Nyeusi near Turkwel and drove away a large herd of cattle, shooting some dead as they fled. The commissioning of the police reservists has now been dismissed as a public relations exercise by the Jubilee&nbsp;government&nbsp;because no cattle have been recovered, no&nbsp;bandit&nbsp;arrested and the attacks continue unabated. &ldquo;We are still living in fear because they attacked a village near Tot last week after the Deputy President left,&rdquo; said Marita Kanda, a resident. Mockery ALSO READ: End the senseless killings in Baringo In the&nbsp;Baringo&nbsp;South attack, the&nbsp;bandits&nbsp;suspected to be&nbsp;from&nbsp;East Pokot made a mockery of the heavy&nbsp;deployment&nbsp;of security&nbsp;forces&nbsp;in&nbsp;Baringo&nbsp;by the DP and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet last month. &ldquo;The minister is concerned about the insecurity in Rift Valley but he is not ready to tell you the number of Kenya Police Reservists (KPR)&nbsp;deployed&nbsp;because it is a security issue,&rdquo; said a senior officer at the Office of The President. Successive&nbsp;governments&nbsp;of presidents Jomo Kenyatta, Daniel Moi, Mwai Kibaki and now Uhuru Kenyatta have failed to deal with the problem,&nbsp;despite&nbsp;both the General Service Unit (GSU) and the army carrying&nbsp;repeated&nbsp;security operations since 1970. The commissioning of the &ldquo;integrated police reservists programme&rdquo; by Ruto and Boinnet to tame the insecurity, which included the arming and equipping of 230 police reservists at Chesongoch village along the&nbsp;Marakwet&nbsp;escarpment, is therefore another desperate attempt. The only difference appears to be that the police officers are better equipped, using armoured personnel carriers which may not be very useful because the hardy little&nbsp;bandits&nbsp;operate&nbsp;from&nbsp;the expansive and almost endless acacia woodlands spread across Kerio Valley. &ldquo;It is difficult for the police and that explains why police officers based in this&nbsp;region&nbsp;prefer to use the services of the armed &lsquo;Ngorokos&rsquo; to chase after attacking&nbsp;bandits,&nbsp;kill&nbsp;some and recover animals for which they later claim credit,&rdquo; said Riong&rsquo;ole Ngolepus, a resident of Lomut in Sogor. Perhaps that also explains why the&nbsp;government&nbsp;has now decided to officially hire police reservists because many police officers have in the past been&nbsp;killed&nbsp;by the&nbsp;bandits&nbsp;during such operations as was a few years&nbsp;ago&nbsp;witnessed in Kapedo, also in&nbsp;Baringo&nbsp;County.

Although no formal training was provided for the reservists, it has emerged that they were meeting every morning at police stations near their homes since last year. &ldquo;Almost everyone here knows how to handle guns so we did not have any training on that but we were mainly trained on how to conduct ourselves when working with the police,&rdquo; said a reservist. The thinking by the&nbsp;government&nbsp;is that once it has integrated as many of the young men as possible, it will be able to contain the problem apart&nbsp;from&nbsp;stopping them&nbsp;from&nbsp;carrying out attacks because they also know active&nbsp;bandits. All reservists in Kerio Valley are under the National Police Service under one police command based in Nakuru, whose leader is answerable to the Office of the President. They have a military chopper whenever required for&nbsp;rapid&nbsp;police&nbsp;response. Some leaders&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;region, including Eldoret Catholic Diocese Bishop Cornelius Korir, have asked the&nbsp;government&nbsp;to immediately&nbsp;deploy&nbsp;adequate and well equipped security personnel to cover Pokot and Turkana areas. Police reservists have therefore been welcomed by some Kenyans and but they are also maligned by critics who argue that they use guns given to them for security to engage in banditry. &ldquo;We need to stop armed groups who are terrorising communities, including even the security&nbsp;forces&nbsp;themselves. Having such groups in any part of our country is unacceptable, quick action must be taken to disarm them,&rdquo; said Bishop Korir.

There are more than 1,000 KPR&nbsp;deployed&nbsp;in the North Rift&nbsp;region.
