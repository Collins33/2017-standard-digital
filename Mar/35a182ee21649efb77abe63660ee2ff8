NAMANGA, KENYA: Normalcy has returned in Namanga at the Kenya-Tanzania Border after a day protest against move by President John Magufuli&rsquo;s administration to repatriate Kenyans. Led by the Kajiado County Governor Dr David Nkedianye, the leaders urged Kenyans leaving at the border to be calm as the two countries are solving the matter. Nkedianye urged other leaders not to incite Kenyans against the Tanzanians, saying both countries should use diplomacy to save the situation. I know other leaders are trying to incite Kenyans to fight back Tanzanians who are leaving with us here, they are our brothers and we should not return fire with fire&#39;&#39; said Nkedianye. Kajiado West Member of Parliament Moses Ole Sakuda said it is not in good spirit to see the Tanzanian Authority kick out Kenyans who have lived there for decades. &#39;&#39;We are shocked by the reports that our people are being chased away from our neighbouring country, however I urge our people to remain calm as the two Authorities work this out&#39;&#39; said Sakuda Kajiado County Commission Harasama Kellow Kello told the Standard on phone that Kenya&rsquo;s top officials from the immigration department, local police officers were locked up in a closed-door meeting in Namanga town to see how the volatile situation could be restored.
