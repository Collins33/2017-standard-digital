&nbsp; The Nyeri County Government has promised to make good the threat to fire striking doctors if they do not show up in hospitals on Monday. Health Executive Charles Githinji gave the 130 doctors in the county until Monday to call off the industrial action and said the county had already written show cause letters to some 20 doctors who played a leading role in the boycotts. &ldquo;I have asked to meet them (doctors) on Tuesday to streamline some of the issues but they only have until Monday to show up before we institute disciplinary action,&rdquo; Dr Githinji said.&nbsp;
