A stand-off looms between Nyeri MCAs and the new governor Samuel Wamathai over operations at the devolved unit. Barely a day after taking over the mantle following the demise of Governor Nderitu Gachagua, Wamathai is facing a fresh revolt from MCAs, who have vowed to reject his nominees. After being sworn in on Wednesday, Wamathai said he was intending to maintain the late Gachagua&#39;s cabinet. Gachagua died at Royal Marsden Hospital in London while undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer. During debate yesterday on the budget committee report on the annual development for 2017/2018, the MCAs pointed out that they were relieved that the county executives would have to undergo fresh vetting. Majority Leader and Budget committee chairperson Duncan Gituanja tabled the report on Annual Development Plan (ADP) in which he noted that most of the proposals in the document should be scrapped because they were a duplication of projects that the county executives had failed to implement.
