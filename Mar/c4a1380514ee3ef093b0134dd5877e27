Nairobi&nbsp;Governor&nbsp;Evans&nbsp;Kidero&nbsp;has&nbsp;urged&nbsp;the&nbsp;business&nbsp;community&nbsp;from&nbsp;Kiambu&nbsp;working&nbsp;in&nbsp;Nairobi&nbsp;to&nbsp;support&nbsp;his&nbsp;re-election&nbsp;bid. Members of the&nbsp;Kiambu-Nairobi&nbsp;Business&nbsp;Community&nbsp;in return asked the&nbsp;governor&nbsp;to address their grievances before the August 8 General Election. They want Dr&nbsp;Kidero&nbsp;to renew their land leases, lower land rates, lower penalties and interests, eradicate land grabbing and establish more markets for food traders before the August 8 elections. Kidero&nbsp;met the Kikuyu Council of Elders and the traders at City Hall yesterday and promised them goodies and protection of their&nbsp;businesses&nbsp;ahead of the polls. &ldquo;We will protect property and&nbsp;businesses&nbsp;and will not allow any disruption of&nbsp;business&nbsp;as&nbsp;has&nbsp;been the case whenever there are elections in the previous years. This year we are demanding that the elections be free and fair so there is no reason for violence,&rdquo;&nbsp;Kidero&nbsp;said. Kikuyu Council of Elders&nbsp;Kiambu&nbsp;chapter Chairman Waweru Mbugua said they were concerned about rampant land grabbing, adding that some officials were evicting tenants before their leases expired. &ldquo;It is very unfortunate that a family that&nbsp;has&nbsp;lived on a piece of land for generations can be evicted without being given a chance to renew the lease,&rdquo; Waweru said. He said traders ferrying produce to the city incurred high costs due to high penalties and rates levied by the county government. Kidero&nbsp;said a food market that will host 5000 traders is being built off Outering Road. He&nbsp;urged&nbsp;the traders to avoid divisive politics, saying&nbsp;Nairobi&nbsp;needs a leader who unites people and provides services to all. He termed&nbsp;his&nbsp;Jubilee competitors as ethnic leaders.
