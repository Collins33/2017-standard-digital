Jubilee leaders from West Pokot County have urged election agency to resist pressure from NASA as it prepares for the August polls. The leaders claimed the Opposition has sensed defeat hence it was raising of unnecessary issues with Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). Led by West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin and Pokot South MP David Pkossing, the leaders said the Opposition is not ready for August elections and has resorted to playing blame games. &ldquo;The Opposition has a hidden agenda concerning the elections and they should come out and tell Kenyans,&rdquo; said Pkossing. Kachapin asked the Opposition to declare their stand about the coming elections instead of propagating false information about IEBC.
