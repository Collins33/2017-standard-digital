A lawyer has sued the Senate and four people who presented a petition in Parliament on alleged impropriety of public funds by the county government. Philip Achiki made an appeal in the High Court to issue temporary orders restraining the Senate from continuing to debate on the petition against Governor John Nyagarama, who is the fifth respondent in the matter. &nbsp;He sought orders to have the Senate&#39;s Public Accounts Committee sittings on the matter suspended until the issue was fully resolved. The lawyer told the court that the governor was a sacrificial lamb in the matter.
