BEIJING: A team of Chinese postgraduates have created an octopus-inspired soft robotic arm that can be used to heal injuries. The students, from Beijing-based Beihang University, exhibited their prototype Thursday after developing it with a foreign firm. Soft robots are constructed with materials like silicone, plastic, fabric, rubber or compliant mechanical parts like springs. &quot;The softness makes it possible for the robots to work more effectively and safely with humans and can be used for rehabilitation and recovery or in the service sector,&quot; said Wang Tianmiao, a robotics engineer at the university. The robotic soft arm is inspired by the tentacles of octopus, Wang said, &quot;It can bend and swirl quickly, and the suction cups help it adhere tightly to objects of different shapes and sizes.&quot; In five to ten years, the robotic arm is expected to be used in minimal-invasive surgery and athletic rehabilitation, said Wen Li, associate professor in Beihang University and head of the team.
