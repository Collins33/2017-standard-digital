Wiper Secretary General Hassan Omar yesterday unveiled his party&#39;s candidate for the Kilifi governor&#39;s seat and declared that his party will not subject its aspirants to joint NASA nominations. The Mombasa Senator said there is no need for NASA affiliates to hold joint nominations in the Coast region because they do not face any danger of losing to Jubilee if they contest. And the Senator equated the proposal of joint nominations to a call to dissolve NASA affiliates. Omar unveiled Michael Tinga to contest against Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi of ODM. Tinga said &quot;there is no Jubilee in Coast and all those defecting to Jubilee are going there alone&quot;. Omar, who faces Hassan Joho for the Mombasa governor&#39;s seat, told Wiper aspirants in Kilifi that it was desirable for candidates within NASA to face each other at the polls. On Wednesday, Joho warned that NASA&#39;s common enemy is Jubilee and appealed to the alliance&#39;s affiliates to concentrate on beating the rival, instead of fighting within. &quot;Our common enemy is from outside and we in ODM do not think our enemy is in ANC, Wiper or Ford Kenya. Those who are talking too much will be shut up for good on August 8,&quot; he said.

Omar however said NASA&#39;s main agenda is to win the presidency. &quot;It was not formed to dissolve other parties and if it were so then it we should have known earlier. The parties have come together as corporate entities,&quot; he said.
