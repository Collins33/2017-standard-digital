Listed insurer Sanlam Kenya has more than doubled its profit for the full-year ended December last year to Sh71 million. The firm, which rebranded from Pan Africa Insurance Holdings at a time its earnings had declined by 97 per cent, appears to have turned a corner after an impressive performance from its general business, prompting it to withdraw a profit warning it had issued in December. The profit is, however, still way below the high of Sh1.25 billion posted in 2013. In 2014, the firm&#39;s earnings dipped by 30.3 per cent to Sh871.1 million followed by another major slump of 97 per cent to just Sh27 million a year later. On both occasions, the firm had to issue profit warnings in line with Capital Markets Authority (CMA) regulations. According to the company&#39;s set of financial statements, last year, Sanlam General Insurance registered a 92 per cent reduction in operating loss from Sh302 million in 2015 to a loss of just Sh24 million. The management attributed the development to its transformation programme after acquiring Gateway Insurance.

The reduction in losses was also supported by a decision by the firm to discontinue underwriting pubic service vehicles as well as improved non-motor to motor business mix. Chief Executive Mugo Kibati said the results were delivered against the backdrop of a challenging business environment, including a depressed stock market, changes in business valuation and introduction a cap on the cost of credit.
