The High Court has frozen Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho&#39;s six bank accounts on claims that he has evaded tax. Justice Hedwig Ong&#39;undi issued the orders yesterday following an application by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), which said the governor owes it millions of shillings in unpaid tax. The orders have affected Joho&#39;s shilling and dollar accounts at&nbsp;CFC Stanbic Bank. &quot;Following the freeze orders, the monies will be preserved for at least 30 days,&quot; Justice Ong&#39;undi said. KRA, through lawyer Silvester Okello, said the governor has not filed his tax returns despite the fact that the accounts have substantial amounts of money.

KRA claims the governor, whom he said has been living lavishly, have Sh38 million. &quot;Despite declaring nil tax returns, the governor is the registered owner of two high-end motor vehicles, a Rolls Royce - KBR 001 R, and Porsche Cayenne - KCG 001J,&quot; the lawyer said. The applicant told the court that it was apparent that the respondent has been in receipt of income on which no taxes have been charged. The lawyer said the commission intends to assess Joho&#39;s income and issue a tax assessment. &quot;If the funds in the accounts of the respondent are not preserved, then it&#39;s likely that he may frustrate the recovery of the tax,&quot; Okello said. Okello said the governor has interests in several companies which have been generating income for him besides his salary, yet he has not filed any tax returns since 2014. He said the last tax returns filed were for 2008-2013, when Joho returned nil income except in 2010.
