The anti-corruption commission has lost a battle to stop the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) from proceeding with a Sh1.2 billion tender for security systems. Court of Appeal judges Wanjiru Karanja, Martha Koome and GBM Kariuki ruled that the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) had not raised anything serious to warrant stopping the contract entered between CBK and Horsebridge Networks Systems Limited. &quot;We have examined the case and find nothing wrong with the contract as ruled by both the Public Procurement Review Board and the High Court. EACC&#39;s contentions lack merit since they have not provided us with any justification to interfere with the contract,&quot; said the judges. The dispute for supply and commissioning of an integrated security system started in May 2012 when CBK advertised for the tender. ALSO READ: Wabukala: Corruption blocking growth in counties
