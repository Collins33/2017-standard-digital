Over 104,000 metric tonnes of fertiliser is ready for distribution to farmers across the country. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett said the supply is a 20 per cent increase from last year&#39;s fertiliser supply, where about 87,000 metric tonnes was distributed. Mr Bett spoke yesterday at Mosoriot National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) depot in Nandi County. &quot;This planting season, the Agriculture Ministry will distribute fertiliser to farmers; the fertiliser has already been distributed to depots to make it easy for them to access&nbsp;the product.&quot; - Rael Jelimo
