NAIROBI, KENYA: The Kenya&nbsp; National Union of Teachers (KNUT)&nbsp; has demanded an unconditional reinstatement of Maseno National School Principal, Mr&nbsp; Paul Otula who has been sent on compulsory leave over the alleged&nbsp; bullying and sexual molestation at the school. The Union&#39;s&nbsp; Secretary General , Wilson Sossion described&nbsp; Mr&nbsp; Otula&#39;s&nbsp; suspension as ill-advised&nbsp; and accused the Ministry of Education and the Teachers&nbsp; Service Commission of harassing&nbsp; school Principals&nbsp; through unfounded rumours. In a letter to the TSC Chief&nbsp; Executive Officer, Mr&nbsp; Sossion&nbsp; said&nbsp; the decision to send&nbsp; Mr&nbsp; Otula on a compulsory&nbsp; 30 days&#39;&nbsp; leave and his subsequent replacement by the Principal of&nbsp; Homa Bay High&nbsp; School was&nbsp; a breach of the law. &quot;This is&nbsp;an event of a chain of systematic attack and harassment on principals and teachers. It is the beginning of a breakdown of&nbsp; efficient&nbsp; management of&nbsp; schools&nbsp; a systematic&nbsp; attack and&nbsp; and harassment based on rumours and unfounded allegations,&quot; Sossion said&nbsp; in the letter dated&nbsp; March 15, 2017 and copied&nbsp; to Education CS, Fred&nbsp; Matiangi. He added: &quot;It is wrong for the TSC and the Ministry of&nbsp;education to act on emotions and impulse without&nbsp;giving a chance to Boards of&nbsp;management of schools to effectively ventilate on internal challenges as&nbsp;maybe pointed out in various&nbsp;investigative reports.&quot; Sossion said&nbsp;the disci0plinary action against Otula should be revoked to&nbsp;allow for the formation of&nbsp;a joint investigative panel of&nbsp;the Board of Management and County Directors&nbsp;of&nbsp;education and TSC. Otula who has been in Maseno since 2001&nbsp;was sent on compulsory leave following reports&nbsp;of&nbsp;bullying and alleged sexual molestation by prefects.
