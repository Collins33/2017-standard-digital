The killings come more than a month after KDF personnel killed 57 terrorists in Afmadow area and two months after the troops were attacked at a camp in Kulbiyow. Besides Kenya, Al-Shabaab has attacked camps belonging to Uganda, Burundi and Ethiopia, with Uganda and Burundi suffering massive causalities. Somalia has not had an effective central government since the 1991 overthrow of President Siad Barre&#39;s military regime, which ushered in more than two decades of anarchy and conflict in a country deeply divided along clan lines.
