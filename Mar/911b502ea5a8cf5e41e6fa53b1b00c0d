The high number of boda boda and tuk tuk riders in town centres has been blamed for the increased number of accidents. Rift Valley Regional Coordinator Ziro Arome said many unqualified people were taking to the roads without proper training. &quot;The operators have really gone up, especially along Kenyatta Avenue in Nakuru town. We agree that it creates employment for our youths but it also comes with a lot of challenges and lawlessness,&quot; said Mr Arome.
