The Independence Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) Chairman Wafula Chebukati has said, the commission will publish names of returning officers and their deputies in due time. The electoral body will also conduct massive transfers of staff involved in voter registration to avoid familiarity with candidates. Speaking in Limuru during a meeting with the National Council of Churches of Kenya, Chebukati said he is aware of challenges that will be involved in party nominations and that his team is working around it. The arising disputes will be dealt with as the commission has set up a code of conduct for aspirants. Chebukati noted that the electoral body has the capacity to conduct August 8 General election and Kenyans should not be scared. He also urged citizens to present their objections as his office is open to criticism. The IEBC Chair urged church leaders to preach peace as the country needs to be united ahead of the elections.
