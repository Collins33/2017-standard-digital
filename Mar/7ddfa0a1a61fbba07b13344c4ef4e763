A refrigerator is one of the most important appliances to focus on when cleaning your kitchen. It houses both raw and cooked foods as well as drinks and condiments. It should be kept clean and hygienic to reduce the risk of food poisoning. Here are some simple steps to ensure that your fridge remains clean and safe. Empty the fridge You can do this all at once or in sections. The thought of the food sitting out helps the work become faster. First, set aside two areas for setting items down: One area for things that need to be cleaned out like outdated leftovers and another area for items that need to be put back into the fridge. Anything that needs to be discarded that is not in a container you want to keep should go into the trash. Clean contents If your fridge is less than pristine, chances are that your milk carton and olive jar aren&rsquo;t squeaky clean either. With a damp rag, wipe the bottoms of items and also clean any drips on the sides. If lid areas need a little cleaning, tackle those too. Next, clean out leftover containers or equally, you can wait until you&rsquo;re done with the fridge and do it later. Clean the inside of the fridge If you can remove shelves and drawers, do it. Spray the inside of the fridge with a solution of vinegar and water, concentrating on soiled areas and let it soak in. Wash the removed shelves and drawers with warm soapy water and set them aside to dry. Head back to the fridge and wipe everything down with a rag. Return contents Dry shelves and drawers and return them to the fridge. Next, place all newly cleaned items back into the fridge in their respective areas.
