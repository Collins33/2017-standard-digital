Governor Amason Kingi&nbsp;accused the Jubilee government of not implementing development projects in the county. Mr Kingi said President Uhuru Kenyatta rides on donor-funded projects to win residents&rsquo; support. The governor said most projects implemented by the National Government like the health equipment for which they pay Sh90 million per year, have pushed the county into debt. &ldquo;The Kenyatta government has done very little for the people of Kilifi. Many projects belong to the County government. We are now paying a debt of Sh90 million yearly because of the health equipment at the Malindi Sub-County hospital. Another one is Sh2.3 billion Magarini-Kakuyuni-Kilifi water project. The loan is being paid to World Bank,&rdquo; he said. Speaking at Chumani in Kilifi North Sub-County during the International Women&rsquo;s Day celebrations, he asked the Jubilee government to waive the county government debts. &ldquo;If Jubilee can waive Sh2.3 billion debt for coffee farmers, let them do the same to the people of Kilifi. We are paying all they say they have given us,&rdquo;he said. ALSO READ: NASA has nothing to offer, says Uhuru as he starts Coast tour
