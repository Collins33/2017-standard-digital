Talks between Kenya Revenue Authority and cargo agents to have their operating licences renewed unconditionally have flopped. The agents have now say they will, beginning tomorrow, down their tools and paralyse the sector&#39;s operations, which could potentially cost the taxman Sh3 billion in lost revenue. The agents, through their umbrella body the Kenya International Freight and Warehousing Association (KIFWA), had last week issued a seven-day ultimatum demanding for an unconditional renewal of their licences. &quot;We expected that both KRA and the Treasury would contact us by Monday regarding the issue of our licenses, but none of them have talked to us. To that end, we shall be downing our tools and paralysing all operations in the country&#39;s entry ports beginning tomorrow,&quot; said the agents&#39; spokesperson William Osoro in Nairobi. KRA has insisted that the agents agree to new rules that require them to get vetted before they are issued with new licences. Commissioner-General John Njiraini has maintained the vetting rule must stand to weed out the sector of rogue operators. ALSO READ: Ibrahimovic, Mings charged over Old Trafford clash
