The Muslim community in Kenya has launched a sharia-compliant TV station. Horizon Television Network, under the Jamia Mosque Committee Nairobi, aims to fight Islamic extremism in Kenya and the region. &ldquo;Media plays a key role in educating the public and by educating our youth about propaganda spread by extremists, we will be fighting them indirectly since will be reaching a wider audience through our platform,&rdquo; said the station&rsquo;s general manager, Ali Mwachuo. He said the station will combine a new approach whereby both the Christian and Muslim communities will have a platform to learn from each other through its programing. &ldquo;The other driver that will set us apart is the fact that we broadcast in English, Kiswahili, and Arabic for our diaspora brothers.&rdquo;
