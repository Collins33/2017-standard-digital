The county government has donated iron sheets and other building materials to a local primary school to repair classrooms destroyed by a storm. About 400 pupils of Tingolo Primary School were left stranded after strong winds blew off the roofs of their classrooms last week. Head teacher Sylvester Musumba hailed the county government for the gesture, terming it a major relief to teachers, pupils and parents. "We'll resume normal learning as soon as the repairs are done," he said yesterday.
