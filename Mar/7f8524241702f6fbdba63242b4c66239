Angry parents&nbsp;stormed Chepketeret Primary School in Keiyo South Constituency, baying for the blood of a teacher accused of sodomising a class eight pupil. It took the intervention of Administration Police officers who bundled the teacher in their vehicle and drove away. A 14-year-old boy, who has been staying with the teacher, claimed the tutor has been forcing him to have sex with him. But the teacher maintained his innocence, saying he has been taking care of the boy. &nbsp;
