Five fishermen died Thursday evening after their boat capsized in Lake Victoria's Bunyala South port in Budalangi Constituency, Busia County. The boat was overloaded at the time of the incident carrying 18 fishermen who were traveling from Nandekhe to Runyu. Three bodies were recovered by Friday morning and search for two missing fisherman was ongoing through the help of local divers. Area MCA Anthony Mayinya termed the incident unfortunate and called on the county to provide more rescue boats and live saver jackets. "I send my condolences to the families who have lost their loved ones. I ask Busia County government to issue more life saver jackets and patrol boats. This area has 500 fishermen who share 15 life saver jackets,'' said Mayinya.
