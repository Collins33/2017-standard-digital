Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has dismissed the national government&#39;s development record at the Coast. Kingi said most projects were launched before the Jubilee administration came to power and that local county governments have been repaying loans borrowed to initiate them. He accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of attempting to convince residents that his government was doing much for them yet it was doing nothing. &quot;Our county pays Sh90 million per year for the Sh900 million medical equipment leased by the national government to Kilifi and Malindi hospitals,&quot; said Kingi. He added: &quot;The Sh2.3 billion Baricho Lot 2 water project the President commissioned last week was built using a loan from the World Bank and which Kilifi county will shoulder.&quot; Kingi said the original loan for the water project was Sh3 billion and challenged the national government to account for the rest of the funds.
