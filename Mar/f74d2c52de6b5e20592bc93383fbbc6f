&nbsp; Former ODM youth leader Rashid Mohammed has bolted out of the race for Mumias West MP seat, days after defecting from Jubilee back to the Orange party. According to his supporters, Rashid will not contest for the seat during this year&#39;s General Election. &quot;He has had a lot of meetings with his supporters trying to explain to them his next move. He has considered a lot of factors through consultations and he will be making the big announcement soon. He may not contest for the seat,&quot; said Ali Abdi, one of his close supporters. He said Rashid was among the top contestants for the seat and if he bolts out of the race, it will be in the favor of the incumbent MP Johnson Naicca. After ditching Jubilee recently to ODM, Rashid was preparing for fierce battle with Naicca for the ODM seat. &ldquo;He has been a strong candidate for the seat, ready to remove Naicca from power but circumstances may not favor him for now thus the move to reconsider his decision to vie for the seat,&rdquo; he said. ODM primaries in Kakamega County are slated for early April. ODM is marshalling support in the county which is perceived to be its stronghold ahead of this year&#39;s election.
