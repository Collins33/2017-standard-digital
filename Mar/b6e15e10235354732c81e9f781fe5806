Talks between striking doctors and the Government stalled yesterday after both sides failed to reach an agreement. The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU), Ministry of Health and Council of Governors (CoG) failed to agree on outstanding issues. The two sides met Law Society of Kenya and Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) mediators for at least one hour last evening. However, Health Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri did not attend the meeting. After the meeting, the KPMDU, CoG and Ministry of Health officials declined to talk to the Press. However, sources told The Standard that the talks had hit a stalemate, even after all sides took a break on Monday to consult their members over outstanding issues.
