Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua&#39;s Maendeleo Chap Chap party will Tuesday hold a convention for all its aspirants at Kasarani Stadium in Nairobi. The meeting to discuss nominations and party structures comes as the new outfit continues to look for ways to harvest defectors from bigger parties. Party leader Alfred Mutua said the agenda of Tuesday&#39;s meeting would include laying strategies to develop strong and transparent party structures. &quot;The structures will guide the party before, during and after the election period,&quot; he said, adding that the party nominations would be free and fair. The meeting follows Dr Mutua&#39;s three-day popularisation tour of western Kenya, where he met aspirants and supporters in Busia, Vihiga, Kakamega and Bungoma counties. Mutua urged voters to elect leaders based on their development records rather than parties or tribal lines. He said the party would support aspirants with campaign materials and other resources.
