Wednesday&rsquo;s edition of&nbsp;The Standard&nbsp;carried a story headlined &lsquo;The other side of Uhuru, Raila&rsquo;. The two politicians share family ties that date back to the days when Kenya was fighting to free itself from the yoke of colonialism. Indeed, Uhuru&rsquo;s father, Jomo Kenyatta, went on to become the first President of independent Kenya while Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Raila&rsquo;s father, became the vice president. The history of Kenya is woven around these two families and despite the differences they display in public as they jostle for political advantage, behind the stage they are the best of friends. Even when it is politically hot, President Kenyatta refers to Mr Odinga as &lsquo;my brother&rsquo;. Looks and the negative perceptions we have of the two, made worse by the ogre of tribalism, should not divide the country for at the end of the day, the country belongs to all of us. Even as campaigns for the August 2017 elections threaten to fray tempers, we must not lose sight of this fact. Elections are a one-time event that should not pit one Kenyan against the other, for if one takes on a brother in a physical fight over the duo, they would be laughing over a cup of tea somewhere.
