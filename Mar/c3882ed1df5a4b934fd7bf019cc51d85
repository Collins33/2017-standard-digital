The&nbsp;arrest&nbsp;and&nbsp;torture&nbsp;of&nbsp;Standard&rsquo;s&nbsp;Isaiah&nbsp;Gwengi&nbsp;has&nbsp;exposed&nbsp;widespread&nbsp;human&nbsp;rights&nbsp;abuses&nbsp;by a&nbsp;police&nbsp;unit&nbsp;in&nbsp;Usenge,&nbsp;Siaya&nbsp;County. Equal&nbsp;rights&nbsp;activists say they have evidence of&nbsp;abuses&nbsp;by the Quick Response&nbsp;Unit&nbsp;and the&nbsp;torture&nbsp;of&nbsp;Gwengi&nbsp;and equal&nbsp;rights crusader Rogers Ochieng was just a tip of the iceberg. A Kenya National&nbsp;Commission on&nbsp;Human&nbsp;Rights&nbsp;official Beryl Orao,&nbsp;rights&nbsp;activists Audi Ogada and Chris Owala said many people who were previously too afraid to speak about their ordeal at the hands of the&nbsp;police&nbsp;officers have found the courage to share their stories. Ogada said they had identified some of the seven officers who&nbsp;tortured&nbsp;the journalist and his colleagues as Sergeant Jarison Laumbauti, Constable Dan Kimari and Corporal Felix Maubi. Ogada said the two were booked in OB 15/22/2017 and were accused of incitement to violence, resisting&nbsp;arrest&nbsp;and assault. &ldquo;We have been reliably told that the officers have previously assaulted an assistant chief of the area who had recorded a statement with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. We have obtained records of other&nbsp;torture&nbsp;victims such as Samson Otieno Olali who reported under OB 10/24/2017 and Omar Issa OB no 11/24/2017,&rdquo; Ogada said. &nbsp;&ldquo;We visited&nbsp;Usenge&nbsp;town on Friday and spoke to the victims of this dreaded&nbsp;police&nbsp;squad. We have confirmed residents have been arbitrarily&nbsp;arrested, beaten and fake charges leveled against them,&rdquo; Ogada said. &ldquo;We went to the offices of the regular&nbsp;police&nbsp;and visited the Got Agulu Health Centre where&nbsp;Gwengi&nbsp;and Ochieng were treated. But their medical records are missing.&rdquo; The officials called on the Inspector General of&nbsp;Police&nbsp;Joseph Boinnet to either completely disband the&nbsp;unit&nbsp;or transfer all the officers at the camp. The equal&nbsp;rights&nbsp;team claimed an officer at the&nbsp;unit&rsquo;s&nbsp;camp threatened to shoot when they insisted on speaking to the&nbsp;unit&rsquo;s&nbsp;commander Inspector Bernard Ongoro. &ldquo;It was bad. This officer told us Inspector Ongoro was away in&nbsp;Siaya. When we requested to see his Deputy, he ordered us to leave,&rdquo; Owala said.
