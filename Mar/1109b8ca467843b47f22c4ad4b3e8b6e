NAIROBI, KENYA: Lawmakers have welcomed with reservations proposals to reduce their salaries after the August polls. President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s announcement during his State of the Nation on Wednesday caught the MPs by surprise with majority opting not to comment on the matter while others argued that it should be implemented at the next general elections. Others supported the recommendations by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) that wants the salaries of public servants rationalised to contain the ballooning wage bill. National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale (Garissa Township), Senate Deputy Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo/Marakwet), National Assembly Minority Leader Francis Nyenze and his deputy Jakoyo Midiwo (Gem) all welcomed the move, saying its high time the country accepted there is a problem and deal with it. &quot;This is a good move. It is sad that 50 percent of revenue goes to less than two percent of the country&#39;s population. This means that over 600 billion goes to people&#39;s pockets,&quot; said Duale. He continued, &quot;Leaders should lead from the front. Those seeking reelection should know what they will earn in the next parliament and other public offices. We should walk the talk.&quot; ALSO READ: Mudavadi responds to President Uhuru over loans Nyenze also called for national dialogue on the matter. &quot;This proposal shows there is a problem. People do not want to talk about it but it is high time we confronted it. We must make hard decisions,&quot; he said.
