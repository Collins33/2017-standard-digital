Immediately after last week&rsquo;s warning by President Uhuru Kenyatta to doctors to resume work or face the sack, 12 doctors at Kenyatta National Hospital were reported to have been served with their dismissal letters. Governors have reiterated the national government&#39;s stand that there will be no further negotiations unless doctors resume work. No doubt, both levels of the government appear to have the upper hand in the matter. What that means is that doctors may be forced to go back to work to keep their jobs and live to fight another day. In the end, all we shall have in public hospitals are demotivated workers without much interest and dedication in their work. These are distractions we don&rsquo;t need in the medical profession where a moment of inattention could result in death. Doctors have come down from their high perch and are willing to meet the Government halfway. At this last possible moment, the Government cannot therefore just walk away. Citizens continue to feel the pinch of hospitals without doctors. There is too much pain, death and agony that the need to strike a balance between the Government and striking doctors cannot be overemphasized.
