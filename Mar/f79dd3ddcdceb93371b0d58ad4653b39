Deputy President William Ruto has said Opposition leaders&rsquo; plans to establish a parallel tallying centre during the election period was a clear indication that Opposition leaders were in a desperate situation after sensing defeat. Addressing a rally in Eldama Ravine grounds in Baringo County on Saturday, the Deputy President told Opposition leaders to seek votes from Kenyans and stop cheating themselves, saying tallying of votes during elections is the constitutional duty of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). &ldquo;It is now obvious that our friends in the opposition have no formula of winning an election because they have no agenda, candidate and they want to have shortcut to win the August election by planning to establish a parallel tallying centre to announce results for themselves as winners,&rdquo; said Mr Ruto. &ldquo;It is only IEBC which is constitutionally mandated to have a tallying centre during elections,&rdquo; added Mr Ruto. The Deputy President told the Opposition not to waste their time on matters outside the Constitution saying IEBC staff should be left to carry out their duties as mandated by the Constitution. Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa told off plans by the Opposition to establish a parallel tallying centre come August elections as a recipe for chaos.

But for the Opposition leaders to tell us they will come up with parallel tallying centre to give different results is dangerous,&rdquo; said Wamalwa. He said the law has allowed IEBC to be the referee on matters of elections and it is its chairman Wanyonyi Chebukati who has final say on results of any election.
