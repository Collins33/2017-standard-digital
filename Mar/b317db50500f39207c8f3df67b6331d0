ABUJA: Three suicide bombers killed four people and injured eight others in a village near the northeast Nigerian city of Maiduguri, a police spokesman said on Sunday. A man and two women blew themselves up when they were challenged by a member of the Civilian JTF, a government-approved militia group, just outside Maiduguri, the city worst hit by jihadist group Boko Haram&#39;s eight-year insurgency. The blasts, in the village of Umariri around 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the city, occurred on Saturday around 9 p.m. (2000 GMT), said Maiduguri police spokesman Victor Isuku. &quot;Four people which include a Civilian JTF [member], a woman and her two children died while eight others sustained injuries,&quot; he said. It is the latest in a string of attacks in the last few days to bear the hallmarks of Boko Haram, which has killed around 15,000 people and forced more than 2 million people to flee their homes in Africa&#39;s most populous nation since 2009. A man claiming to be the group&#39;s leader appeared in a video circulated on Friday in which he claimed responsibility for bombings in Maiduguri and a raid on the nearby town of Magumeri last week. He also denied that 5,000 hostages held by the group had been freed.
