Busia County government and education officials are headed for a confrontation after differing on whether or not to close down 12 local private schools over the curriculum. The County Education Board has demanded the closure of Bridge International Schools because they are not teaching the Kenyan curriculum. Board chairman Stephen Odebero said the schools had not met requirements for registration as a learning institution in Kenya. Last month, a Busia court ordered 10 out of 12 Bridge International Schools institutions closed down if they failed to meet the board&#39;s requirements by April. However, Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has vowed not to allow the closures because the schools had helped to bridge a shortage in the region. The governor said closing down the 12 schools, with a pupil population of 1,200, would lead to a crisis.

We need to encourage private schools to come up and bridge the gap so our children remain assured of getting an education,&quot; said Mr Ojaamong. The board is expected to meet today to discuss the matter and reach a final decision. Jackline Walumbe, a manager with Bridge International Schools, said they had complied with all the requirements and did not understand why the board was hell-bent on closing their schools. &quot;We have done everything that was required; all our 12 schools are compliant,&quot; she said yesterday. Parents joined the fray, threatening to take to the streets if the education board went ahead and closed the schools.
