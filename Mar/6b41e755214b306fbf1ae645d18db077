Nearly all women politicians say they have encountered threats and abuse at some point while in office. Yesterday, women lawmakers in Parliament and in county assemblies recounted the trials they have endured in the past&nbsp; four years. Some said they received death threats, suffered sexual harassment or were forced to bribe colleagues to pass privately sponsored Bills in the county assemblies. Speaking in Mombasa ahead of the legislative summit, most women lawmakers said they felt &quot;less safe&quot; as the country heads to the August 8 general elections. Nominated Senator Martha Wangari said the mistreatment or discrimination was not unique to women Members of County Assemblies (MCAs), saying even at the Senate, nominated women senators faced similar challenges. &quot;We have even been called bonga points. People are yet to understand that all Members of Parliament (MPs) or MCAs are equal regardless of how they come to the house,&quot; said Wangari.

She said that a large number of nominated female MCAs were openly harassed for sexual favours in lobbying for bills.
