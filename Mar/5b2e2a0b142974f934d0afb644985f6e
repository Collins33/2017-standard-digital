NAIROBI, KENYA: Kenya&rsquo;s Sidian Bank has turned to IBM Cloud and Cognitive solutions to fuel its digital transformation. According to the bank, the transition will help offer growing customer base of small and medium-sized businesses with faster access to existing services like debit and credit card processing, bank account opening, teller services and wealth management. Prior to engaging IBM, about 40 percent of a typical business day&rsquo;s working hours at the bank was spent on problem isolation. Today, however, through infrastructure as a service and cognitive management, the system can learn from past incidents and resolve 56 percent of any difficulties with minimum human intervention. This has enabled the bank realise 34 percent savings in capital expenses and a 60 percent improvement in transactional times across all ATMs and teller counters. &ldquo;This is the first collaboration of its kind in this market. It not only cements our partnership with the IBM, but also creates new and unique partnerships that support our institution&rsquo;s growth strategy and enhances the efficiency of our entire banking infrastructure.&rdquo; said Titus Karanja, CEO, Sidian Bank. &nbsp; With the IBM cognitive capabilities, the bank continues to drive fast response times to customer needs which are key to supporting its mostly small and medium-sized tier entrepreneurs.
