President Uhuru Kenyatta has replaced Jubilee Party Acting Secretary-General Veronica Maina in preparation for the August polls. Jubilee Head of Secretariat Raphael Tuju takes over from Ms Maina and will now steer the party through the critical election period. During a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting chaired by Uhuru and his deputy, William Ruto, at State House yesterday, Uhuru said the changes were in line with the party&#39;s constitution. Maina, who was retained as acting secretary-general following the merger of the Jubilee parties, will now serve as deputy chairperson. She had served the defunct Jubilee Alliance Party (JAP) in the same capacity. Also appointed is Andrew Musangi, who will head the party&#39;s National Elections Board (NEB).
