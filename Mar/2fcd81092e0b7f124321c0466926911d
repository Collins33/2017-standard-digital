President Uhuru Kenyatta returns to the Coast&nbsp;where he is expected to receive defectors from ODM in a bid to demonstrate that Jubilee is gaining ground in the region. Taita Taveta Senator Dan Mwazo and Woman Representative Joyce Lay are to officially join Jubilee. Uhuru, who is traveling with Deputy President William Ruto, will open the Kongowea market, which Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho opened. The President and his deputy will then head to Tononoka Grounds for a rally. The two leaders began their tour of Coast in Lamu and Kilifi on Thursday. Uhuru&rsquo;s past visits in the region have often ended in bitter spats between top Jubilee stalwarts and government officials on one side and Governor Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi on the other.

On Thursday, Joho declared that no matter how much Jubilee tries to win support at the Coast, it will lose the August polls. &ldquo;On August 9, those who are talking too much will shut down for good,&rdquo; he said. Jubilee leaders said the Tononoka rally will also be addressed by Mombasa&nbsp; governor candidate Suleiman Shahbal and his running mate Ananiah Mwaboza.
