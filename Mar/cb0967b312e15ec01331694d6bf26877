Gospel&nbsp;artiste&nbsp;Rufftone&nbsp;has&nbsp;no&nbsp;doubt&nbsp;made&nbsp;a&nbsp;mark&nbsp;in the&nbsp;music&nbsp;industry. But&nbsp;what&nbsp;many&nbsp;people&nbsp;may&nbsp;not&nbsp;know&nbsp;is that&nbsp;he&nbsp;is&nbsp;also&nbsp;striving&nbsp;to&nbsp;make&nbsp;a&nbsp;mark&nbsp;on the&nbsp;farming&nbsp;front.&nbsp;Yep, the&nbsp;guy&nbsp;is a&nbsp;solid dairy&nbsp;farmer. &ldquo;Many&nbsp;Kenyans&nbsp;may&nbsp;not&nbsp;know&nbsp;it but I am actually a&nbsp;farmer.&nbsp;Many&nbsp;have seen me perform in the studio, at national events and concerts, but they&nbsp;may&nbsp;not&nbsp;know&nbsp;that I am very conversant with matters&nbsp;farming,&rdquo;&nbsp;he&nbsp;says. Since 2006,&nbsp;Rufftone&nbsp;has&nbsp;been running a&nbsp;dairy&nbsp;unit in Eshifiru village in Kakamega County. His main market is Kakamega Market Centre. &ldquo;I have a few&nbsp;dairy&nbsp;cows whose milk earns me some decent money,&rdquo; the singer says. Rufftone&nbsp;says&nbsp;he&nbsp;started out with an expensive cross breed, Jersey calf, that cost him Sh20,000 but&nbsp;has&nbsp;since diversified to different breeds. &ldquo;Like all young&nbsp;farmers, I started small but with time, my herd&nbsp;has&nbsp;increased. I have seen this single calf grow and give birth to all these cows. It&nbsp;has&nbsp;been a journey of ups and downs,&rdquo;&nbsp;he&nbsp;shares. ALSO READ: Why do my pigs bite off each others tails? But since&nbsp;he&nbsp;was in his&nbsp;music&nbsp;career (going to studio to record new songs and all)&nbsp;he&nbsp;had to create time, every so often to go and check on the animal. Luckily for him, his mother is based in upcountry, so she&nbsp;also&nbsp;played a big role in ensuring the projects did not fail. A successful&nbsp;dairy&nbsp;project is measured by a number of key performance indicators,&quot; says the &#39;Mwikulu&#39; hit singer. &quot;And one of these is the amount of milk the cows produce at different stages especially the lactation stage. &ldquo;In my journey as a&nbsp;farmer, I have come to realise that to get that right, there are certain things that I have to get right in the first place. It&rsquo;s a mix of good genes, the amount of feed the animal gets, how you treat it and how well you take care of it. &quot;For instance, when the animal is sick, do you call a quack or involve a vet? I have learnt to always deal with experts and to give my cattle quality feed and as and when required. Clean water is&nbsp;also&nbsp;mandatory,&rdquo;&nbsp;he&nbsp;says. That strategic and intentional care&nbsp;has&nbsp;ensured that his cows produce enough milk. &ldquo;They&nbsp;may&nbsp;not be super milk producers, but at least they produce enough milk that can be consumed at home and some that we sell,&rdquo;&nbsp;Rufftone&nbsp;points out. But pray,&nbsp;what&nbsp;prompted the&nbsp;gospel&nbsp;artiste&nbsp;to venture into this field?
