I&nbsp;had&nbsp;just&nbsp;finished&nbsp;my&nbsp;Fourth&nbsp;Form&nbsp;and&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t&nbsp;sure&nbsp;I&nbsp;would&nbsp;secure&nbsp;a&nbsp;place&nbsp;at&nbsp;vet&nbsp;school&nbsp;when&nbsp;Lazaro&rsquo;s&nbsp;only&nbsp;cow&nbsp;suffered&nbsp;a &ldquo;funny&nbsp;disease&rdquo;. I&nbsp;got interested because&nbsp;I&nbsp;had&nbsp;wished to study&nbsp;vet&nbsp;medicine in the near future. Although Lazaro thought otherwise, the&nbsp;disease&nbsp;was killer rabies shared between man and animals &ndash; zoonotic and mainly spread by infected dogs (rabid dogs). Lazaro&rsquo;s&nbsp;cow&nbsp;had&nbsp;gone nuts and made strange sounds. Though not on heat, the animal produced lots of saliva but couldn&rsquo;t swallow feeds and walked with an awkward gait. The animal was normally calm but now it was aggressive and reacted to light and sounds. The&nbsp;cow&nbsp;sometimes ran away from people and at other times ran after them. According to Lazaro, these signs pointed to one thing - his animal&nbsp;had&nbsp;been bewitched. He&nbsp;had&nbsp;refused to trace it back to a stray dog bite. This stray dog&nbsp;had&nbsp;held the entire Lung&rsquo;anyiro village at ransom for a week. It&nbsp;had&nbsp;been spotted by at least three other people within the neighbourhood. Like the&nbsp;cow, it also behaved in a&nbsp;funnyway. Evil hand to blame ALSO READ: I use cabbage to kill lethal worms Everyone was on the lookout and whenever it was spotted, people shouted it&nbsp;just&nbsp;disappeared into the sugar cane plantations nearby. That&nbsp;only&nbsp;Lazaro&rsquo;s&nbsp;cow&nbsp;had&nbsp;been bitten fanned his belief&nbsp; that there must be some evil hand in his predicament. After attacking&nbsp;Lazaro&rsquo;s&nbsp;animal,the dog disappeared never to be seen again. Indigenous knowledge has it that bewitched animals aren&rsquo;t to be touched and&nbsp;when&nbsp;Lazaro&rsquo;s&nbsp;cow&nbsp;died, it was burnt to exorcise the evil spell and that is how rabies was controlled effectively. In many agricultural extension programmes, such effective indigenous knowledge is never considered as an intervention despite its potency. While villagers believe in devouring carcasses from suspect animals despite veterinary doctors warning, whenever&nbsp;I&nbsp;recall this particular case&nbsp;I&nbsp;marvel at the power of indigenous knowledge. When&nbsp;I&nbsp;joined&nbsp;Vet&nbsp;School&nbsp;and Prof Kitala was teaching us about rabies which is a killer viral&nbsp;disease&nbsp;that affects all warm-blooded mammals including man,&nbsp;I&nbsp;understood it from a firsthand experience. Rabies affects the central nervous system hence the clinical signs. The virus is present in the saliva of infected animals and is spread through contact with open wounds or mucuos membranes.

Cows&nbsp;infected with rabies will have difficulties swallowing and some farmers are normally tempted to put their hand inside the&nbsp;cow&rsquo;s&nbsp;mouth to find out if there is any obstruction. This is a risky step that can result in infection. Dog mediated rabies is still a major problem in Kenya. The&nbsp;disease&nbsp;has a case fatality of almost 100 per cent (this means that once infected chances of recovery are very slim) Routine vaccination of dogs which are the main transmitters of the&nbsp;disease&nbsp;through their bites is being promoted by the World Health Organisation and the Organisation for Animal Health.
