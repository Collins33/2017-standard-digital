The electoral agency has repossessed 200 voter registration kits it gave the National Youth Service (NYS) in efforts to address the integrity of the voter register. The decision by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) came against the backdrop of claims by the Opposition of a mysterious listing of youths under the guise of youth service programmes. IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati said the step was meant to assure the public that the August 8 General Election would be free and fair. A total of 196 kits were handed to the commission, while four are still at Gigiri Police Station awaiting completion of investigations. The four were confiscated following the arrest of three NYS staff during the mass voter registration that ended on February 19. They were allegedly registering voters using a BVR kit at the PCEA Beula Church in Runda, Nairobi.
