Telkom Kenya is rolling out free Wi-Fi through the Government-funded Constituency Incubation Hubs in the 290 constituencies across the country. This initiative, a partnership of the Ministry of ICT and the National Constituency Development Fund (NCDF), will see Telkom Kenya install 1,160 Constituency Incubation Hubs, four per constituency, which will be equipped with 40 tablet devices per incubation hub. The Hubs will benefit youth entrepreneurs by way of helping them develop their ICT skills and applications, bringing them into the digital world and enabling them to grow and start new businesses. The National Constituency Development Fund will fund the project for the supply and installation of the equipment component while the Ministry of ICT will fund the provision of Internet broadband services for a period of one year. Speaking upon confirmation of the award of the Wi-Fi project, Managing Director of the Enterprise Division at Telkom Kenya, Kris Senanu, said, &ldquo;We are excited about the roll-out of this new government project.&rdquo;
