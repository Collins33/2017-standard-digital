Marakwet East MP Daisy Kanainza Nyongesa says doctors have proved that they are not interested in service delivery, writes Silas Koskei It is irresponsible for President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Council of Governors to use intimidating sentiments on a matter that is serious as doctors&rsquo; strike. Kenyatta&rsquo;s attribute during the opening of devolution conference that doctors are blackmailers was uncalled for and inhuman to citizens that have constantly dedicated their time to save lives. The grievances by doctors are genuine but the sad reality is that the Government has been playing cheap games in pretext of listening to their demands. It is a calculated move for the Head of State and the Council of Governors to accuse the doctors who have been willing to accept the offer on the table only for them to say that the mediation talks have failed to bear fruit. Although they insist that the strike has paralysed and left many citizens in pain, why has the Government failed to heed to the concerns of the doctors. They also have families and deserve good working conditions.

It is also improper for governors to threaten doctors insisting that it will deregister unions that have constantly played a role in championing for their interests. The doctors should stay put until the Government heeds to their demands because they are employees who demand equal treatment like other citizens. &mdash; Daisy Kanainza Nyongesa, ODM Nominated Senator
