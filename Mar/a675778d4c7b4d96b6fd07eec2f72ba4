A woman described by the prosecution as a notorious illicit brewer was yesterday handed a two-year jail term if she fails to pay a Sh500,000 fine. Gladys Karwirwa was convicted by Chief Magistrate Lucy Ambasi on her own plea of guilt. She admitted possessing half a litre of chang&rsquo;aa without a brewing permit, an offence committed on March 3 at Karimene village, North Imenti. She also admitted a second offence of possessing 40 litres of muna (an ingredient for making chang&rsquo;aa) without a permit on the same date and place. Previously, she had been been fined Sh50,000 for the same offence. &nbsp;
