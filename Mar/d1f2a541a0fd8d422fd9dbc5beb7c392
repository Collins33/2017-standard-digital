Jubilee Party was forced to call off a forum meant for selecting nine member of Murang&#39;a county election board on Saturday after the exercise became chaotic. What was expected to be a peaceful exercise at Murang&#39;a Teachers Training College quickly turned into disarray after governor Mwangi wa Iria&#39;s supporters stormed the venue and rejected the officials deployed to oversee the exercise. Wa Iria&#39;s supporters removed spikes placed by police officers and overpowered the security officers at the gate and gained entry into the facility. Other aspirants who included Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau walked into the venue. Police were forced to use teargas canisters to disperse Iria and his supporters. His bodyguards were forced to whisk him away to his vehicle as hundreds of his supporters engaged police in a running battle. The battle for political supremacy between Iria and Kamau once again played out as their supporters clashed as police intervened to separate them. Kamau was in support of the election while Iria said the elections were marred with irregularities and would undermine the integrity of the party.

Kamau on his part accused Iria of sabotaging the exercise by allowing his supporters into the venue. At about 3 pm, the members were vetted and allowed into the hall with VIP urged to leave behind their armed escort. Addressing the meeting, Leah Ntimama said the election will be done on Tuesday following a communication she obtained from the party secretariat.
