Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (NAMATA) has been allocated Sh200 million to help solve traffic mess in the city and its environs. Speaking during the first Nairobi Metropolitan Area Council meeting Friday, Transport CS James Macharia said the core agenda is to set-up modalities for establishment and structure of the NAMATA authority. &ldquo;The authority&rsquo;s mandate is to provide a dynamic and achievable platform that will resolve decades-old traffic challenges,&rdquo; he said. The committee which includes Governors Evans Kidero (Nairobi) Mwangi wa Iria (Murang&rsquo;a), William Kabogo (Kiambu), Alfred Mutua (Machakos) and David Nkedianye (Kajiado) will fast track the setting up of the authority considering the significance of the transport sector on the economy. NAMATA was established by an Executive Order on February 9. It is an interim measure pending the enactment of a Statute that will establish a fully-fledged Authority with expanded powers and a broader mandate. ALSO READ: Kenya granted direct flights to America
