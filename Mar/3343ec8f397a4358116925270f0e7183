Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has urged politicians to campaign peacefully and educate citizens on the need to vote. Speaking at Emining in Baringo County, where he attended a service at the Africa Inland Church, Mr Moi called on politicians to avoid divisive politics. He thanked the church for its role of encouraging unity even when people differ on political ideology. &quot;Let us come together and do our politics in peace and avoid dividing Kenyans for our own personal interest,&quot; said Moi. The senator, who was later in the company of Baringo Woman Representative aspirant Gladwell Cheruiyot and Mogotio MP aspirant Noah Chepkech, at a rally in Emining, called on aspirants to avoid mudslinging others. The senator said he was saddened that some aspirants were spreading rumours and propaganda about the ongoing operation in Baringo aimed at flushing out bandits.

They have been going around saying that I am against the operation and you know them. Leadership cannot be about lies. Let them learn that when you want something, you don&#39;t follow deceitful ways but be yourself and tell people what you want and have for them,&quot; he said. He urged area residents not to be fooled and told them to be careful in choosing their leaders. &quot;We need courageous people and if you feel you are not in a position to handle the pressure, stay back and don&#39;t spread propaganda,&quot; he added. He advised the aspirants to accept the will of the people after the polls, noting that Kanu supports the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. &quot;We, as Kanu, have granted them support. An Uhuru win means a win for his deputy, but I wonder why he keeps pursuing me.&quot; He said the Kalenjin community needs peace.
