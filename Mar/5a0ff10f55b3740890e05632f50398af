The brother of former US President Barack Obama, Malik, has been dismissed as &ldquo;bizarre and bitter&rdquo; after he posted a fake birth certificate purporting that Obama was born in Mombasa, Kenya. The Obama family Saturday described Malik&rsquo;s post as &ldquo;pure madness&rdquo; and a work of a &ldquo;frustrated man seeking global attention&rdquo;. &ldquo;I want Kenyans and the international community to ignore this man. His outbursts are a disgrace to the family,&rdquo; said Obama&rsquo;s uncle Said Obama in Kogelo, Siaya County. The UK newspaper, Daily Mail, described him as &ldquo;malicious and attention-seeking Malik&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s online publication (dailymail.co.uk) categorised Malik&rsquo;s series of tweets as &ldquo;bizarre and bitter&rdquo;. Malik has sustained his open hatred for his brother who ruled the US for eight years and at whose wedding with Michelle, he was the best man.

He wrote: &ldquo;Surely what is this? So True.&rdquo; During US presidential campaigns last year, Republican candidate Donald Trump once publicly claimed that President Obama as not an American citizen, a claim the government dismissed. The US Constitution bars citizens who were born abroad from the presidency. Daily Mail wrote, &ldquo;In an effort to put the matter to rest, the Obama White House released a copy of his long-form birth certificate in 2011.&rdquo; It declared the certificate Malik posted a forgery. Said told The Standard on Sunday that Malik, who endorsed president Donald Trump, was always tweeting derogatory statements against his family as a strategy of raising funds for his foundation, which ironically is named after Barack Obama. Saturday, after the Daily Mail wrote a hard hitting story on him, Malik tweeted: &ldquo;Malicious Malik: Daily Mail is Super Cuck; Newspaper Top grade.&rdquo; In other tweets, he praised president Trump, saying: &ldquo;President Trump is Elvis Presley reincarnate. The King himself.&rdquo; ALSO READ: Kenya must face Trump to avert bullying of its citizens In another, he asked for donations towards his Obama Foundation and attacked those who were unwilling to support him. &ldquo;Crooked, Dishonest and Corrupt Media, Won&rsquo;t say anything about my efforts to raise funds for needy students,&rdquo; he twitted on March 3. He was at it again on March 5, &ldquo;What is Barack Obama going to do that he could not do for his family?
