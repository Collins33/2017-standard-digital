Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has denied reports linking him to secret foreign accounts, terming them malicious, false and baseless. Kalonzo, who addressed NASA rallies in Isiolo County Saturday, claimed that Jubilee had originated the claims with the sole aim of denting his chances of clinching the Opposition&rsquo;s presidential ticket. He said the Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation operates above board. More than 2,000 students from underprivileged backgrounds throughout Kenya have benefited from the foundation, Kalonzo added. &ldquo;These people have just realised that Kalonzo is becoming more and more popular. This is just a strategy to derail my chances to be the NASA presidential candidate. It is bound to fail,&rdquo; he said. The former Vice President wondered why the reports were disseminated to the press before informing him. &ldquo;To prove their mischief, Jubilee decided to send the false report to the media to ensure bad publicity, instead of the procedural process of serving the affected party first,&rdquo; he said.

The Wiper leader paraded a young man &ndash; Abdul Latif from Kinna village &ndash; a Mt Kenya University student, who has been a direct beneficiary of his foundation. &ldquo;You see this young man here? He is benefiting from the foundation, but instead of Jubilee helping such young people, it is busy stealing from public coffers,&rdquo; said Kalonzo. He also lashed out at Jubilee for ignoring the plight of Isiolo County residents as well as other marginalised groups in Kenya. Kalonzo was with Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, who accused Jubilee of reneging on its promises to Kenyans, including failure to provide laptops to pupils. He also accused the government of abetting tribalism and corruption.
