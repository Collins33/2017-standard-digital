Senator Boni Khalwale has accused the national government of undermining the Senate for the last four years. The senator also accused the National Assembly of frustrating senators in their bid to safeguard devolution. &ldquo;Kenyans wished that the Senate could do a lot to protect devolution, but from the start the Executive arm headed by President Uhuru Kenyatta never wanted the Senate to work,&rdquo; said Dr Khalwale.
