BUNGOMA, KENYA: More than 5,000 farmers in Bumula Constituency are set to receive free top-dressing fertilisers from the County Government of Bungoma. Governor Ken Lusaka, who is leading the exercise, said it is meant to make Bungoma a food secure county, and better the living standards of the less fortunate in the society. &quot;In the wake of food shortage that has led to high prices, all eyes are now on Bungoma, one of Kenya&#39;s key food baskets. Hopefully, by next year, we will have a surplus,&quot; the Governor said at Kabula. The distribution of free top-dressing comes barely a month after the Government distributed free planting fertilisers to more than 50,000 residents of Bungoma, translating to atleast 700 farmers a ward. Today&#39;s distribution covered Kabula, South Bukusu, Khasoko, Bumula, West Bukusu, Kimaeti and Siboti. All constituencies in Bungoma are expected to receive the crucial farm input.&nbsp; According to Governor Lusaka, the free inputs supply kicked off in 2013 with the distribution of the commodity to 200 farmers a ward. This was increased to 400 in 2016 before it was expanded to 700 this year. &quot;It is a dream that must come true; that of making Bungoma a fully independent country in terms of food supply. I expect this distribution to rise to 1,000 farmers a Ward next year,&quot; he said.
