The average human is said to have sex a grand total of 5,778 times before they die. Whether that seems a little or a lot is totally your business, but one thing is for sure - &quot;dry spells&quot; happen to even the most libidinous of people. Maybe it&#39;s self-imposed. Maybe it&#39;s just the way the rotten cookie of life sometime crumbles. Whatever the story behind your fallow bedroom times, a lack of sex will (unsurprisingly) have a knock-on effect on your body and general psyche. Here&#39;s what you can expect to happen when you&#39;re not having regular sex. 1. You lose your libido.

Some people find the idea of sex even more desirable when having a dry spell. 2. starting over may hurt This mainly applies to women entering the menopause. Sari explains, &quot;Without regular frequency of intercourse as you get older the walls of your vagina thin out and can lead to painful sex when you finally get back into the sack.&quot; ALSO READ: Why men 'never' admit they are wrong To this end, the North American Menopause Society even recommends having regular sex to help vaginal health during menopause. 3. You may experience a loss of lubrication. Another side-effect which applies principally to older women, apparently the vagina struggles to get lubricated when you start having intercourse after a hiatus. What cause this - as well as thinning vaginal walls - is a lack of the hormone, oestrogen. &quot;If you take a young woman who&#39;s 20 or 30 years old she&rsquo;s going to have plenty of oestrogen around to make sure those tissues stay healthy&quot; explains Dr.Lauren Streicher. 4. Your period pain may get worse. Undeniably, it&#39;s women who are coming worse off.

However - you lessen your risk of catching a UTI. Finally, that silver lining. Unsurprisingly, not only do you dramatically decrease your chances of being infected with an STD, but also UTIs too. There is a strong link between UTIs and regular intercourse because of the spread of bacteria which can occur. &quot;It&#39;s intercourse that&#39;s responsible for potentially increasing the risk of recurrent bladder infections,&quot; says Dr Streicher. 80 per cent of UTIs in premenopausal women occur within 24 hours of having sex, and as the journal American Family Physician stated, &quot;Frequency of sexual intercourse is the strongest predictor of recurrent urinary tract infections.&quot; ALSO READ: Woman swallows Sh700,000 in desperate bid to hide cash from husband
