ODM governorship aspirants in western Kenya will spearhead Orange party campaigns in the region. The aspirants are keen to frustrate efforts by NASA affiliate parties to lock the Orange party out of the region. Amani National Congress (ANC) and Ford Kenya have vowed to &#39;kill&#39; ODM in the region, saying residents would only vote for Raila Odinga for the presidency and no ODM candidate for the lower seats. In Busia County, Governor Sospeter Ojaamong said he would ensure ODM gets all seven parliamentary seats and a majority of ward positions. &quot;ODM will fight to maintain its popularity in the region,&quot; Ojaamong said in an interview with The Standard. Ojaamong is targeting to meet grassroot leaders in all sub-counties in Busia to tame popularity of other parties and boost his chances of being re-elected.

In Bungoma, Alfred Khang&#39;ati (governor aspirant) will lead the party brigade to deliver the county to ODM. Bungoma has been perceived as a stronghold of Ford Kenya, whose leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula is the county&#39;s senator. In Vihiga, Wilbur Otichillo will spearhead campaigns to ensure the party beats the growing popularity of ANC, which is led by Musalia Mudavadi. Ford Kenya leader Wetang&#39;ula and his deputy Boni Khalwale said they would support Raila for the presidency but campaign against other ODM candidates.
