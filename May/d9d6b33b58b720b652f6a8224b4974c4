National Super Alliance (NASA) co-principal Isaac Ruto has asked the Jubilee government to relinquish power for failing to tame the spiralling cost of living. Mr Ruto, who is also the governor for Bomet County, said Kenyans could not suffer for another five years under the Jubilee administration. The Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) party leader accused the Government of ruining the economy and perpetrating tribalism. &quot;We want a non-tribal Kenya for all the 43 tribes, not the one dominated by two tribes as exhibited by Jubilee,&quot; said Mr Ruto. The former Council of Governors chairman also said Jubilee had scuttled devolution by withholding more than Sh74 billion meant for the 47 counties. He said NASA would increase the budgetary allocation to the 47 counties from the current 30 per cent to 45 per cent.
