Kanu officials in Nyanza have begun preparations for a strong come back in the race for President in 2022. National Executive Council member and the Deputy Organising Secretary Jack Nyambega said they are supporting President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Jubilee Party for re-election in this year&rsquo;s election, but will field Chairman Gideon Moi in 2022. &lsquo;&rsquo;We may have not fielded a presidential candidate for the August General Election in favour of President Uhuru, but God willing, come 2022 our candidate will be Gideon,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Nyambega. On Tuesday, all Kanu branch executive members from Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, Nyamira, Migori and Kisii counties will meet in Kisumu to chart the way forward. Some of the issues to be deliberated include reviving the old Kanu network as well reactivating party offices in the six counties, sources revealed. &lsquo;&rsquo;We want to open an office in every county. When others will be busy looking for the presidency, we will be pre-occupied building our house to make our way to power,&rsquo;&rsquo; stated Nyambega. Kanu Kisumu branch Secretary Ken Onyango on the other hand, observed that: &ldquo;Our aim is that come 2022, Kanu should have done enough ground work and picked all the strong candidates to field in all the 290 constituencies.&rdquo; The Nyanza team this morning heads to Laikipia to campaign for Senate aspirant Maina Njenga. Gideon will be the Chief Guest. ALSO READ: Chaos erupt over ODM nominees list Mr Onyango said they want Gideon to prepare and begin countrywide tours to market himself to Kenyans.
