British actor Roger Moore, who won international fame playing secret agent James Bond, died on Tuesday aged 89, his family said on the actor&#39;s official Twitter account. His 12 years as James Bond, the British agent with a voracious appetite for danger and sex, made Moore a millionaire and a heartthrob the world over. &quot;It is with a heavy heart that we must announce our loving father, Sir Roger Moore, has passed away today in Switzerland after a short but brave battle with cancer,&quot; his three children announced in a statement on the Twitter account. The son of a London policeman, Moore once said the upper-crust image he portrayed both on and off the screen was a carefully nurtured cover for his shyness and timidity. He also said he was terrified of playing the sex scenes which were a key part of the Bond movies. Moore&#39;s big breakthrough as an actor came in 1962, when he won the part of &quot;?The Saint&quot; in a popular television series of the same name. In this role, he honed his image of the urbane Englishman with a stream of damsels to rescue from distress. In 1973 came the coveted part of James Bond, writer Ian Fleming&#39;s action man spy 007, who held cinemagoers across the world in thrall. The Bond films were said to have earned Moore 14 million pounds ($22 million). He moved to the United States to become a tax exile. &quot;I don&#39;t see why a chap shouldn&#39;t do what he likes and live where he wants on his money, and the British government, which allows talent to go abroad because of taxation, has only itself to blame,&quot; he said in an interview in 1989. After handing over the role of Bond to Timothy Dalton, Moore went into semi-retirement, living a millionaire&#39;s life and traveling between his homes in Los Angeles, Switzerland and the south of France. In 1991, he became an ambassador for the United Nations Children&#39;s Fund. Moore is survived by his fourth wife, Scandinavian socialite Kristina &quot;Kiki&quot; Tholstrup, whom he married in 2002.
