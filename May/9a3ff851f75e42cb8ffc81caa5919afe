Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has defended his decision to vie as an independent candidate. Mr Kabogo said his decision, made after his opponent, Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu, was declared the Jubilee Party nominee for the governor&#39;s seat, was informed by the party&#39;s reluctance to look into the issues he had raised. He said the primaries were marred by irregularities as the party register was not used to identify voters and his opponent had inflated votes. Kabogo said even after submitting his complaints to the party authorities and being assured of justice, nothing was done. &quot;It is strange that even the returning officers who were trained for the nominations were not the ones present during the exercise,&quot; said Kabogo. &quot;I did not dump Jubilee but Jubilee dumped me,&quot; said Kabogo, adding that he would still campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election.

Kabogo is said to have got 69,916 votes in the primaries against Waititu&#39;s over 300,000.
