Over 12,000 Nairobi County employees have received a 15 per cent pay rise following a new pay deal between the city government and their union. Kenya County Government Workers Union (KCGWU) Secretary General Roba Duba, the County Public Service Board Chairman Philip Kung&#39;u and the Federation of Kenyan Employers signed a collective bargaining agreement at Charter Hall on Friday. Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero said the pay increment was meant to cushion workers from the rising cost of living. &quot;Inflation is at seven-and-a-half per cent per year. Over the past four years, they have not received a pay rise, meaning they are earning 40 per cent less than what they are supposed to,&quot; he said. &quot;Some of them are unable to satisfactorily fend for their families and also serve our residents as expected,&quot; he added. &quot;This CBA was voluntarily negotiated in accordance with the employment law and labour relations. It contains improvement and better interpretation of the old CBAs and is contextualised in terms of the devolved system,&quot; Duba said. The county&#39;s wage bill, which stands at Sh1.25 billion per month, is now expected to rise to Sh1.43 billion.
