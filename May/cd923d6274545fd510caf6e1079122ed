At least 30 people in Sitotwet village, Ainamoi Constituency were sent into panic after consuming meat of a cow suspected to have been bitten by a rabid dog. The villagers forced health officers to administer anti-rabies vaccine after learning that the cow could have been infected with rabies. Wilson Kirui, the owner of the cow, claimed though he had ordered the slaughter and proper disposal of the carcass after the animal begun exhibiting bizarre behaviour, a section of the villagers disregarded his advice. &quot;It is unfortunate the people I had hired to slaughter and bury the animal decided to share a portion of the meat among themselves, claiming they were taking it to feed their dogs. They feasted on it and sold some to unsuspecting residents,&quot; said Kirui. Ainamoi sub-county Medical Officer of Health Dr Gilbert Langat, said though rabies had not manifested among the villagers, they decided to apply preventive measures by administering the anti-rabies jab.&nbsp;
