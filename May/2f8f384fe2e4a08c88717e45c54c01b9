Former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru&rsquo;s political future hangs in the balance after MPs demanded that a report on the National Youth Service scandal be implemented. The report recommended that she be barred from holding public office. While debating the report by the Public Accounts Committee Wednesday, legislators insisted that those mentioned be held accountable. &ldquo;This matter made some of us to make enemies. The saga was a well-designed, well-orchestrated, and planned. From the probe we discovered that government funds are not well utilised. Our efforts should not go down the drain,&rdquo; said PAC vice-chairman Jackson Rop (Kipkelion West). The committee had in March recommended that Waiguru, who recently clinched the Kirinyaga county Jubilee Party gubernatorial ticket, be barred from holding public office should she be found guilty over the NYS fraud. &ldquo;The NYS scandal will remain the largest in the Jubilee administration. It was shocking in nature, well-crafted, clearly thought through, and involved sophisticated professionals. The only way you can appreciate the efforts we made as a committee is to adopt the report,&rdquo; Abdikadir Aden of Mbalambala told MPs. Johana Ng&rsquo;eno (Emurua Dikirr) and Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) said it was shocking that the Jubilee Party awarded nomination certificates to Waiguru and other people mentioned in the report, including Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen.
