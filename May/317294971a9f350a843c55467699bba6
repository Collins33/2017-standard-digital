A magistrate&#39;s court in Embu has issued a warrant of arrest against Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire and Embu Speaker Kariuki Mate. The two failed to show up in a case where they are charged with obstructing a police officer from carrying out his duties. Police say the two leaders and their supporters obstructed&nbsp;Embu West OCPD Francis Sang and other officers from picking the county returning officer, Kenneth Kamenchu, from&nbsp;Embu level five hospital to take him to Kangaru tallying centre to announce Jubilee Party nomination results. Mr Kamenchu, who had earlier been injured after rowdy youths attacked him at the tallying centre, was rushed to the hospital with head and hand injuries. The prosecution told the court investigations had been concluded and the two would be charged with the offence when they appear in court. Resident magistrate Julian Ndengeri directed that the two leaders should appear in person on Thursday May 4 to face charges. ALSO READ: NASA warns IEBC, Jubilee on provisional results appeal &nbsp;
