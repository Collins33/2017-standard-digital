Former Naivasha MP John Mututho, who lost in the Jubilee Party primaries, has declared that he will run as an independent candidate for the Nakuru governor&#39;s seat. After losing the nomination to former NTSA chairman Lee Kinyanjui, Mututho vowed that he would be on the ballot. Speaking to journalists in Naivasha, the former Nacada chairman termed the nominations a sham. Mututho, who had indicated that he would respect the will of the people during the nominations, claimed that the polls were not free and fair.
