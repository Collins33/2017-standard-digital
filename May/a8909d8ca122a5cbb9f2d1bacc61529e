With less than 75 days to the General Election, residents held a walk in support of peaceful campaigns. They were led by National Government county administrators. The walk was from Magandia to Kombani in Matuga sub-county. Speaking after the walk, County Commissioner Kutswa Olaka said security agents were committed to ensuring that there is peace during the campaigns and election. Mr Olaka said those who would be found to be involved in violence would be dealt with according to the law. &quot;As we wait for the August 8 elections, let us commit ourselves to maintaining peace. When we engage in violence, we will be hurting our families, friends, and neighbours.

Youths were described as vulnerable as they were the targets of politicians who want to use them to propagate violence. Tatu Tinga, a resident, said the people should not allow politicians to incite them during political rallies. &quot;Sometimes you find two different parties claiming that they are holding their meeting at the same venue. That should not happen because it is a recipe for chaos,&quot; said Ms Tinga.
