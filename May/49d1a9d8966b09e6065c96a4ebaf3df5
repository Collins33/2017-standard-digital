Safaricom said on Monday it aims to expand its M-Pesa financial services across Africa after South Africa&#39;s Vodacom buys a 35 percent stake in the Kenyan telecoms operator from Britain&#39;s Vodafone. Safaricom, which dominates mobile telephony in Kenya with 28 million subscribers, said in a statement that Vodafone had offered &quot;appropriate assurances&quot; to the Kenyan government, which is also a shareholder in Safaricom, before the deal was announced. &nbsp;
