Beyond the picture-perfect skyscrapers of the Central Business District, filth and neglect reign in the back streets. The huge potholes turn into dams whenever it rains, thanks largely to a poor drainage system. Moi Lane, behind the Tusky&rsquo;s chain Beba Beba branch is such a case. It is characterised by a pungent stench while heaps of garbage litter the busy street &ndash; making it one of the city&rsquo;s most polluted bacl-alleys. The sordid sight is a daily reality to those who eke out a living around this area, to a point that they are used to an ever-present stench despite paying requisite fees to the City County government to be allowed to run their businesses. Foul smell Simon Mwangi, a driver of a matatu plying the Westlands-Kangemi route casually dismisses any hope to have the lane rehabilitated. &ldquo;We are used to the mess here. Since 2013 I have only seen the road repaired once,&rdquo; said Mwangi. ALSO READ: There is a lot of good going for Nairobi City He adds that garbage is rarely collected. The once tarmacked road is now full of potholes that are filled with pools of sewage water. It also lacks a drainage system, making the lane almost completely inaccessible during rainy seasons. Another matatu operator in the area who referred to himself as Muthee said they suffer a lot especially during rainy seasons. Since the KMO Sacco matatus have nowhere else to park their vehicles, as they wait for passengers, they have to brave the foul smell. The lane is also used by No 44 Nazigi Matatu going to Kahawa West. Most of the drivers have however learnt to avoid the deep potholes, but once in a while one is caught off-guard. The state of the road becomes even more serious considering there are small hotels on the busy lane.
