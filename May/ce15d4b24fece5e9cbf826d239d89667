County askaris have been accused of beating up Standard journalist Dan Ocholla, severely injuring him. Ocholla was attacked on Saturday evening as he took photographs of workers who were injured when a building under construction at the county headquarters collapsed. &quot;I was taking photos of those injured on the second floor when the askaris started chasing me with rungus. They attempted to snatch my camera and mobile phone,&quot; said Ocholla, who has recorded a statement at the Kakamega Police Station. He was treated at the Kakamega referral hospital.
