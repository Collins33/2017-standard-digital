A Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) Church pastor is yet to be traced, twelve days after he went missing from his home in Borabu, Nyamira County. Pastor Nicholas Kibagendi of Nyamira Conference headquarters, left his home at Riensune village on Thursday April 20, at around 8am after receiving a call. According to his wife Jennifer, the pastor received a call and walked out of his house while talking on the phone and headed towards Keroka town on foot. The 54-year old father of five left, never to return leaving his family. According to records, his phone&rsquo;s signal was last used on the fateful day at Nyansiongo Maket, a kilometer away from his home.&nbsp; &ldquo;He left as we were preparing breakfast but did not return. I was worried and I called his two lines around noon but they were both off,&rdquo; Jennifer said.&nbsp; The wife said she reported the matter to police but to date, whereabouts of her husband remain unknown. Jennifer, a primary school teacher who says the husband has never expressed any fears over his life, is now appealing to police and the public to help trace the pastor. The Nyamira Conference, his employer, has since taken up the matter and made announcements in all its churches and radio stations in a bid to find him.
