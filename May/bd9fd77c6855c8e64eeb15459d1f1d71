A recent shortage of the supposed &quot;super food&quot; is causing outrage on social media, as it emerges that supply can&#39;t keep up with demand. Prices have soared after poor harvests in Mexico, Peru and California, meaning Instagram-loving foodies now have to pay even more for their smashed avocado on toast. According to Bloomberg, a 10kg box of Hass avocados from Mexico now costs around &pound;21 - more than twice the price it was back in 2016. Some have suggested that the surge in demand from China&#39;s emerging middle class is also having an unprecedented effect. University of Huddersfield lecturer David Harvey points out that the 100 MILLION people that make up China&#39;s middle class are also developing a taste for avocado. &quot;Avocados &ndash; or &ldquo;butter fruit&rdquo; as they are known &ndash; are also relatively new there, having only been available in exclusive outlets for a few years,&quot; he writes.

Interestingly, the old avo&#39; is also full of calories and monunsaturated fat - but that doesn&#39;t make for a good hashtag. A quick Instagram search for #Avocado turns up 5,818,219 public posts at the time of writing.
