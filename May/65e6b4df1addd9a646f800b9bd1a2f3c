The National Super Alliance (NASA), in a show of might, took their campaign to Nakuru town, where they asked residents to rally behind the coalition. Addressing residents at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru, NASA principals Raila Odinga (ODM) Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Isaac Ruto (CCM) and Moses Wetang&#39;ula (Ford Kenya) vowed if elected to liberate Kenyans from bad governance of the Jubilee regime. The event marked NASA&rsquo;s first rally since the coalition unveiled Raila Odinga as its flag-bearer. Raila&#39;s running mate Kalonzo Musyoka said they will hold parallel tallying to track the campaign results but they will not announce the results as it is IEBC&rsquo;s mandate to do so.
