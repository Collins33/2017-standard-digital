NASA affiliate parties are still negotiating to field one candidate for every elective seat in the city. Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and his deputy Jonathan Mueke said on Saturday that talks were still ongoing to identify strong candidates. &quot;The affiliate parties are still working on the same because it is our plan to clinch as many seats as possible,&quot; said Dr Kidero. The county chief had attended church service at the Eastleigh SDA Church. The affiliate parties include Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), Wiper Democratic Movement (WDM), Amani National Congress (ANC), Ford Kenya and Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM). Mr Mueke said the matter was before the NASA technical committee, which would give direction this week. He said that he had presented the proposal to the committee and had faith that the issue would be sorted out in the course of this week.

This was manifested after individual parties conducted successful nominations in the city and fielded candidates for respective positions. NASA had been pushing for the fielding of joint candidates as a weapon to beat Jubilee. Kidero said the alliance had lost many seats in the precious elections because individual parties had fielded candidates and this split the votes. Interestingly, ODM has already fielded candidates for Senate, woman representative, 15 parliamentary seats and more than 60 MCA seats. Businesswoman Esther Passaris was cleared by the Orange party to fly its flag for the woman representative seat. ODM had also handed a direct certificate to Chapia Bukachi to contest the city Senate seat, but this was later withdrawn and awarded to lawyer Edwin Sifuna.
