Nairobi Kenya: President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced 18 per cent increase in minimum wage during the Labour Day celebrations at Uhuru Park, Nairobi. Up to Sh100,000 of bonuses and overtime shall not be taxed in order to cushion Kenyans from high cost of living. The minimum taxable salary shall be Sh13,475. Central Organisation of Trade Unions had requested for a 22 per cent increase in basic pay, citing inflation which has constantly been increasing. The president said progress to build a prosperous economy to allow Kenyans earn decent living was on course. He underlined current efforts in road construction, lowering barriers to trade, quality education as some of the strategies. The President urged employers to ensure workers are safe and said State will soon embark on inspection of safety at work place to ensure compliance.
