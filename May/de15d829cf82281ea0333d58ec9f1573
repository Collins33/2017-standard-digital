KIAMBU, KENYA: Bidco Africa has embarked on an ambitious expansion plan as it moves to widen its revenue base. The expansion plan will see four new factories being built at the new Bidco Industrial park near Tatu city in Ruiru. Bidco Chairman Vimal Shah said the company has already started the expansion programme that will cost them Sh 20 billion. The first phase which will be completed by the end of this year will include an initial Sh5 billion with the second phase amounting to Sh 15 billion being spread for the next four years. Shah said the company is seeking to increase their competitive advantage as it diversifies on products by launching new ones in the market. The products will among others entail juices, water, cosmetics and other fast moving goods which will include food products. &quot;With the expansion, we are seeking to raise our annual turnover from the current Sh40 billion to Sh100 billion in the next five years. We are hoping to start production of some of the products by the end of this year,&quot; said Mr Shah. He said the ambitious expansion programme that will see the creation of about 2500 and about 200,000 indirect jobs will be funded through partnerships and acquisitions. Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA) Chairman Nick Nesbitt who was chief guest said corruption was ruining down business, entrepreneurships and denting the country&#39;s image. &quot;If as a country we want to focus on growth, we have to ensure ethic and integrity in all our dealings.&quot; said Mr Nesbitt.
