Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero met Kamba elders in Nairobi in an attempt to woo voters as he prepares to fight to retain his seat. On Tuesday, the governor and his deputy Jonathan Mueke met more than Kamba 100 elders in an event attended by NASA principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula. A group of elders led by Sam Mumbi, endorsed the duo for a second term, promising to fight off any threat posed by Senator Mike Sonko. &ldquo;Those who lost in the party primaries should be humble and support the governor and his deputy. We will influence the Kamba community to rally behind Mueke,&rdquo; said Mumbi. In 2013, the senator garnered over 800,000 votes while Dr Kidero managed slightly over 690,000. Kidero has retained Mr Mueke as his running mate in an attempt to cement the Kamba support.
