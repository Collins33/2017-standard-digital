A non-negotiable requirement to support President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election bid for aspirants in Maendeleo Chap Chap (MCC) Saturday saw the incumbent being endorsed to vie for the country&#39;s top job. The party&#39;s leader and also Machakos Governor Dr Alfred Mutua said they discussed on their position in the upcoming general election and settled on the incumbent as the suitable candidate. &quot;And since we have no presidential candidate in this year&#39;s election, we decided to give you(President Uhuru Kenyatta) another term,&quot; said Mutua. In an event that attended by 3,500 delegates, MCC aspirants were made to take oaths of integrity not to engage in corrupt dealings once elected all witnessed by President Uhuru himself at the party&#39;s headquarters. Mutua said Jubilee government&#39;s has had an unmatched record in development citing free maternity programmes, last mile connectivity and road projects-that have been a controversial topic among the opposition-as some of the incumbent&#39;s milestones. &quot;The country has not witnessed such empowerment of the youth with setting up of polytechnics at least in every constituency-like it is the case today. This is a government with a score card,&quot; said Mutua dismissing the opposition&#39;s pledge of a better country.

But you (Uhuru) have come out against it and every Kenyan knows you are a clean man.&quot; He added that as part of cementing President Uhuru&#39;s support, it was a requirement that any aspirant who joined MCC to pledge their support for Uhuru. Speaking during the endorsement, President Uhuru took the platform to hit at the opposition describing their new outfit of the National Super Alliance (Nasa) as a selfish and job seeking venture for the principals. He said Kenyans have matured democratically and the country has no space for tribal leadership that has only yielded problems and hatred. &quot;For a whole year they sat down not to discuss how to solve problems of 40 million Kenyans but how to give jobs to some four people,&quot; said Uhuru. Uhuru said once he clinches a second term, he will create an inclusive government-just like the present one- where MCC members will be part of. &quot;We do not believe in individualistic leadership like our opponents. Our aim is to form a government for the good of all people,&quot; Uhuru said. ALSO READ: Raila Odinga: This is my last battle
