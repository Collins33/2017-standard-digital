As a light rain fell on and off throughout Yale University&#39;s 316th graduation ceremony on May 22, a thunderous applause announced the conferment of degrees on the Yale College graduates of 2017. Among them were seven distinguished guests receiving honorary doctorates. Although happening across the Atlantic, this ceremony marked another major milestone in the life of one of Africa&#39;s most prolific literary luminaries &ndash; Ngugi wa Thiong&#39;o. The colourful ceremony saw the professor receive his 12th honorary degree; Doctor of Letters (Litt.D.) alongside seven other prominent personalities including John Kerry, former US Secretary of State, and Steve Wonder, the musician celebrated for among others, being the first African American to win an Oscar for Best Original Song, the 1984 hit single, &#39;I Just Called to Say I Love You.&#39; The skies were smiling yet again for the Distinguished Professor of Comparative Literature and English at the University of California, Irvine, whose prowess and mastery in capturing socio-political events and issues affecting developing countries has seen him win innumerable accolades. Contentious work Prof Ngugi, an indefatigable Kenyan author, playwright, editor, social activist and academic published by East African Educational Publishers (EAEP), spent 22 years in exile for his contentious political work. It was his vocal advocacy for the common man and sharp criticism of injustices in post-colonial Kenya that saw him imprisoned without charge in 1977. His release was secured in 1978 after Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience. Although barred from working at colleges or universities in the country, Ngugi kept up his passionate and prolific writing even after his exile in 1982, with most of his work revolving around the politics of culture in post-colonial Africa as well as the Caribbean. His determination and never-fading spirit to express his mind through the written word is aptly captured in his essay published in &#39;Coming of Age: Strides in African Publishing: Essays in Honour of Dr Henry Chakava @ 70.&#39; He says: &quot;&#39;Matigari&#39; was to my exile what &#39;Devil on the Cross&#39; was to my prison. Writing them, under trying conditions, was my way of fighting back, and frankly, bolstering my spirits.&quot; Renowned worldwide, Ngugi&#39;s contributions to the body of critical writing on African literature, politics and society have been highly significant, and have profoundly influenced other writers, critics, scholars and students. Among his famous publications are &#39;Decolonizing the Mind&#39;; &#39;Globalectics&#39;; &#39;Remembering Africa&#39;; &#39;Dreams in a Time of War: A Childhood Memoir&#39;; &#39;A Grain of Wheat&#39;; &#39;Devil on the Cross&#39;; &#39;Petals of Blood&#39;; &#39;The River Between&#39;; &#39;Weep Not, Child&#39;; and &#39;I Will Marry When I Want.&#39;&nbsp;
