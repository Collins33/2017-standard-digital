Governor Jackson Mandago wants the retirement age lowered from 60 to 55 years. He said this would create room for more youths to get employment. &nbsp;&quot;I urge the National Assembly and Public Service Commission to consider lowering the retirement age so that many college and university graduates being released into the job market have something to do,&quot; Mr Mandago said. &nbsp;&quot;Lowering the retirement age will also reduce the funds used to pay public servants,&quot; he added.&nbsp;
