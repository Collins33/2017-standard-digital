Tension is high at Rubere in Laikipia West after bandits suspected to be from Baringo County attacked residents on Tuesday. The bandits paralysed a security meeting by shooting in the air, dispersing the residents and security officers. Several residents were injured as they scampered for safety during the 2pm incident. According to Githiga MCA Peter Thomi, the residents had gathered to address rising cases of insecurity when the criminals struck. He said they appeared from the Laikipia Nature and Conservancy Ranch and started shooting indiscriminately. &quot;They were about 10, all armed with guns, and they started shooting towards where the residents had convened. Luckily, no one was shot,&quot; he said. Mr Thomi said the residents scampered for safety as security officers exchanged fire with the attackers.
