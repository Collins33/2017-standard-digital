A man has been allowed to bury his daughter after a dispute with his mother-in-law. A local court ruled on Wednesday that Geoffrey Oduor, from Khadoda village, Nambale constituency, has the right to bury his 11-year-old daughter. The body of Faith Achieng&#39;i, who was a Standard Three pupil at Bridge International Academies in Nambale, has been lying at the Busia District Hospital mortuary since last year due to the dispute. Oduor sought the court&#39;s intervention after his daughter&#39;s grandmother, Alice Nabwire, prevented him from burying her. She argued that Oduor had no right to bury the girl because he had disowned her in 2008, saying he was not her biological father The child was living with her grandparents at the time of her death. Nabwire further said Oduor had failed to fulfil his responsibilities to the child.

The magistrate insisted that the offer would settle the dispute amicably. The two families were encouraged to cooperate and give the child a good send-off. Oduor accused his mother-in-law of frustrating him and delaying the girl&#39;s burial. He lauded the verdict, saying he would start making burial arrangements immediately. &quot;It has taken too long, but I am happy the verdict is out and I have been granted the right to bury my child,&quot; said Oduor. Fridah Apiyo, Achieng&#39;i&#39;s mother, died in 2013 and was buried at her parents&#39; home. Oduor said he did not attend the funeral because he was not informed of her death.
