Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) has won a competitive bid to spearhead an innovation and technology transfer initiative aimed at fostering agro-processing in the coconut industry. As a Research Chair on Technology and Manufacturing, JKUAT is expected to design and develop tools and machines for production and commercialisation of coconut. Coconut is widely distributed along the Kenyan coastline, yet little research has gone into its value-chain, denying the country substantial economic returns such as job creation and export earnings. Over 10 by-products can be generated from the coconut fruit alone.
