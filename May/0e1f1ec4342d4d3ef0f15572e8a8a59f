The Party of National Unity (PNU) plans to call a National Executive Committee meeting to re-endorse President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election. The decision to organise another delegates&rsquo; conference to re-endorse Kenyatta for the seat comes in the wake of comments made by Senator Kiraitu Murungi and Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi to the effect that the party&rsquo;s leader, Governor Peter Munya, was fronting the National Super Alliance (NASA) agenda in Meru. Political battle Mr Murungi and Mr Munya are locked in a fierce battle for the Meru governor&rsquo;s seat in the August 8 polls. Addressing Jubilee rallies in the region, Murungi and Mr Linturi claimed that Governor Munya has been funding NASA&rsquo;s meetings. Murungi said Munya was not supporting Uhuru&rsquo;s re-election because he has not led PNU in endorsing Uhuru, as did a number of parties.

I am in PNU and we support the re-election of Uhuru Kenyatta. Period!&rdquo; said Munya. His party officials have also come out in his defence. Wednesday John Okemwa, the PNU Secretary-General, denied the two leaders&rsquo; claims, accusing them of spreading falsehoods. Mr Okemwa and PNU Acting Executive Director Peter Kaberia said they would convene the NEC meeting &ldquo;to put this matter to rest once and for all&rdquo;. &ldquo;We are going to seek an appointment with State House to see if the President is available soon so that we can re-endorse him. In October last year we held our National Delegates Convention (NDC), where Munya was unveiled as party leader and where he announced the party&rsquo;s support for Uhuru&rsquo;s re-election,&rdquo; said Okemwa. He dismissed as &lsquo;propaganda&rsquo; claims that the Council of Governors chairman was not backing Uhuru&rsquo;s re-election bid.

We are appalled at the attempt by senior people in Meru to tarnish the good name of the party. Kiraitu ceased being the PNU secretary-general, but if he is bitter, misses it, and wants to come back, we welcome him,&rdquo; Okemwa added. He said though the budget for another NDC meeting was enormous, the party was ready to host delegates to set the record straight on Murungi&rsquo;s claims and &ldquo;put this matter to rest one and for all&rdquo;.
