Trans-Nzoia County&#39;s maize production is expected to drop by 1.2 million bags this season due to Fall Army worm invasion and poor rain patterns. The county produces about 5 million bags annually from over 100,000 hectares of land normally put under maize production. County Agriculture Chief Officer Mrs. Mary Nzomo also disclosed that of 50 per cent of land translating to 53,500 hectares in County have not been planted due to lack of rains. She said that 20 per cent of land which had been planted last February had a failed germination leaving several farmers to count losses. Tran-Nzoia County, a major maize producer contributes about 40 per cent to the country&#39;s 41 million bags annual requirement. Mrs. Nzomo said many farmers in the county were unable to plant due to lack of rains while handful of those who engaged in dry planting were forced to replant after failed germination. She said yields for this season will reduce following the invasion by the pest and poor rains which had delayed planting. &quot;We expect to harvest 3.8 million bags from the annual yields of 5 million bags. The production has been affected by the invasion of the pest and delayed planting due to poor rain pattern,&quot; said Mrs. Nzomo. Fall armyworm spotted last December is blamed for crop destruction in the county after sweeping maize fields in the area. Both the County and National Government have stepped up efforts to fight the pest which has left several farmers counting losses.
