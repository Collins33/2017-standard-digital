KAKAMEGA, KENYA: Maize flour prices are still high in major supermarkets in Kakamega town, a spot check by The Standard on Thursday reveals. The supermarkets have maintained the initial prices of maize flour which stands at Sh 160 instead of Sh90 for the 2 kilogrammes. The town&#39;s major food outlets attributed the high price to slow transition between millers and wholesalers. &quot;We have to wait for the millers to send us the new batch which takes roughly two days on the road to get here,&quot; said a supermarket attendant. On Tuesday, the government issued a directive that the cost be reduced to Sh90. Residents who thronged most of these shops were frustrated by the prices and some opted to buy the alternative maize flour from local posho mills.

According to Tuskys Customer Care official, James Wagura, the supermarket received overwhelming number of customers making the commodity be cleared from the stall immediately. &quot;I was informed by a friend that Tuskys has reduced the price. This is not the case since I have found the subsidized brand has been depleted from the shelf. I shall buy wheat flour instead since it&rsquo;s cheaper than maize flour,&quot; said Rhoda Onyino.
