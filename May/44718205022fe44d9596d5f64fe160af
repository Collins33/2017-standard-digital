Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has accused Jubilee Party nomination losers who are vying as Independents of double standards. Mr Keter said by so doing, they are not expressing goodwill and might cost the party some seats. &ldquo;You cannot claim to be supporting the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta and on the other hand undermining the party,&rdquo; he said. The legislator further argued that the independent candidates have no moral authority to direct the President and his deputy William Ruto on party affairs. Speaking in Njoro, Nakuru County during a thanksgiving for Phillip Rotich who won the JP ticket for Mauche Ward, Keter called on Governor Kinuthia Mbugua to support former Nakuru Town MP Lee Kinyanjui who trounced him in the nominations. &ldquo;Mbugua should support Kinyanjui. A good leader respects the voice of the people and if they decide to change leadership one should step down honourably,&rdquo; said Keter. Kinyanjui said after losing the TNA primaries to the Governor in 2013, he selflessly supported him expecting that he would do the same if he (Mbugua) finds himself in a similar situation.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Group wants Kajiado West Jubilee nominee academic papers probed
