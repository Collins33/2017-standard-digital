Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader Musalia Mudavadi has chided independent candidates in Western region and warned them against using National Super Alliance (NASA) symbols. Mr Mudavadi spelt doom for independent candidates and all parties in the region that are not aligned to NASA. He made the remarks in Vihiga when he visited his backyard for the first time to quell disquiet in NASA after last month&#39;s nominations that left many aspirants discontented. While meeting ANC aspirants who participated in nominations at Sosa Cottages, Mudavadi said he had sacrificed his presidential ambitions and there was need for other people to sacrifice too. &quot;In nominations, we all suffered. I have lost an election before, but I&#39;m still alive. Let us not give up hope. Abraham Lincoln lost 16 elections, but later on came to be a president. Make ANC a dominant party by sacrificing your ambitions sometimes,&quot; he told the aspirants. He added: &quot;I have not gone independent because I lost NASA flag bearer position. Why are you not ready to sacrifice too?&quot; ALSO READ: Jubilee nominees meet to counter wave of Independents He said even after having been at the forefront in creation of the Opposition alliance, he has been lenient enough to allow other people take high positions without bolting out. &quot;The reality for independent candidates is that they will be stopped from using NASA symbols. They cannot use our platforms to advance their interests yet they refuse to support others,&quot; Mudavadi said.
