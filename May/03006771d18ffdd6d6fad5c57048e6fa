Controversial Senator Paul&nbsp;Njoroge has reignited his war of words with the Deputy President William Ruto two months to the General Election. The senator now claims that the DP is systematically locking out politicians from Central Kenya and Rift Valley whom he perceives as his enemies. Njoroge who represents the disabled in the senate lashed out at Ruto over his high handedness on those he professed as blocking his chances of becoming the next President. And in a hard hitting statement, Njoroge told the deputy president that Central Kenya was rethinking its decision in supporting his presidential bid&nbsp;come 2022. This emerged when the senator who is seeking the governor seat in Nakuru County on KANU ticket addressed the press in Naivasha where he called for peaceful campaigns. According to Njoroge, the Deputy President had resorted in using government agencies to antagonize those opposed to his style of leadership.
