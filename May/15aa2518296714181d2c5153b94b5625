The Jubilee Party is on the spot for handing a nomination certificate to an aspirant facing allegations of presenting a forged national examination certificate. The Kenya National Examinations Council had indicated that Robert Githongo, who is vying for the Kiamwangi ward seat in Gatundu South, forged his Form Four certificate. Mr Githongo, who emerged victorious in the Jubilee nominations, was among the aspirants who were recently awarded party certificates by Secretary General Raphael Tuju. On Wednesday, Mr Tuju said he was not aware of the forged documents, adding that the party would act once it received evidence.
