The Government has suspended operations of the Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation and frozen its accounts. While communicating the decision, the Non-Government Organisations Coordination Board accused the foundation of engaging in money laundering and operating illegal accounts. The board claimed the foundation was unable to account for Sh196 million, including Sh50 million from Chinese donors, and initiated a legal process of ascertaining the criminal culpability of its directors, who include former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka (trustee and patron). The others are Kalonzo&rsquo;s wife Pauline (trustee and chairperson), his son Kennedy (secretary) and a fourth person listed as Martha Mulwa (treasurer). The development came after Kalonzo was named the NASA presidential running mate. The Government says it will deregister the foundation and also disband its board of directors and possibly charge Kalonzo in court.
