Governor Amason Kingi has questioned what he terms &quot;mass transfers&quot; of police officers, court and judicial officers ahead of the August elections. Speaking during the Judiciary Open Day at Marafa sports grounds in Magarini on Saturday, Mr Kingi demanded an explanation for the sudden changes. He claimed the transfers were politically motivated. All the judges at the High Court in Malindi and over 70 police officers were transferred last week. &quot;We want to believe the transfers are in good faith and not aimed at influencing the coming elections. The transfers are suspect, especially because of the huge number of police officers that have been moved in one go,&quot; said Kingi. He condemned changes in the Judiciary, saying they were aimed at posting national government-friendly judges and magistrates to the region.
