The County Government of Trans Nzoia has established ten plant clinics to help in the fight against pests and diseases. Deputy Governor Stanley Tarus said the clinics will also provide health extension services and&nbsp;help local farmers monitor and address challenges hampering food production. The clinics will entail pests and diseases diagnosis facilities while the technical team will advise farmers. The move comes as the country grapples with the fall army worm pest that has threatened food production, especially in Trans Nzoia and neighbouring counties where several maize farms have been affected. The county has partnered with Plantwise, the national Government and other stakeholders to initiate the programme. Plantwise, a global programme led by Centre for Agriculture Bioscience Institute (CABI)&nbsp;has committed to help wipe out fall army worm pests in order to increase food security and improve rural livelihoods. &ldquo;The programme was initiated in Kenya in May 2012 and is anchored in the Department of Agriculture under the Directorate of Extension Services,&rdquo; he added.
