MERU, KENYA: Counties are yet to receive money to pay doctors for the three months they were on strike, council of governor&#39;s chairman Peter Munya has said. The governor however said Meru County, will have to pass a supplementary budget to pay the medics. &quot;For now we urge the doctors not to go slow as their money is in the pipeline,&quot; Munya said. He however confirmed that counties have received money to increase doctor&#39;s salaries from May. &quot;We received the money two days ago to pay doctors and nurses so we are going to give them pay increase but we are yet to receive funds to pay clinical officers and other cadres in the health sector,&quot; Munya said. He urged health CS Cleopha Mailu to send the money to pay the clinical officers and other cadres in the health sector. &quot;We know that President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered doctors to be paid for the three months they were on strike. We are very willing to pay but we have so far not received any funds, we promise to pay soon as we get it,&quot; Munya said. ALSO READ: Court: No doctors from Tanzania
