Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa has assured farmers that maize imports will not flood the market and destabilise prices. Mr Wamalwa said the imports were to help reduce the cost of maize flour and would be exhausted before the harvest in October. The CS was reacting to fears among Trans Nzoia farmers that the imports from Mexico would flood the market and affect local maize prices. Remain stable Speaking at Kalua farm in Kiminini during the burial of Ruth Nyairo, the wife of lawyer Alfred Nyairo, Eugene assured farmers that the maize prices would remain stable. &quot;The imports will not flood the market and will be exhausted before this season&#39;s crop is harvested and the prices will remain stable,&quot; said the CS.

This is an emergency to address the food crisis in the country and let me assure you that there is a will from the Government to support farming in the county,&quot; said the Cabinet minister. Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa claimed there was a deliberate plot by some individuals to cash in on the food shortages.
