A mother of seven claims that she lost Sh315,000 to two men who promised to ensure that her son joins the Kenya Police Service. The widow, Mary Moraa, said her son was not picked to join the force on recruitment day at Masimba play ground on May 11. As he left the grounds, he met a man who alleged that he had received a recruitment letter from senior offices in Kisii town after paying Sh200,000. The man directed mother and son to Kisii town, where they met two men at the Kisii Central police station who ended up conning them of the money.
