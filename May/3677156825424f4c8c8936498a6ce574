Succulent, appetising nyama choma (roast meat) is something most people in Nairobi look forward to, especially over the weekends. However, this nyama choma trend, is also catching on during weekdays. Depending on one&rsquo;s location in the city, there is always a well-known nyama choma place that is agreeable to all, if not most. For those on the Westlands side of the city, the place to be is Njuguna&rsquo;s along Waiyaki Way. To Brian John (BJ), Njuguna&rsquo;s is synonymous with meat and is one place that has stood the test of time. Over the years, Njuguna&rsquo;s has come to be known for its meat. &ldquo;On a random Saturday you are bound to find the parking full,&rdquo; says BJ. The cars one spots at Njuguna&rsquo;s range from the ordinary Toyotas to high-end guzzlers, which perhaps indicates the diversity of the clientele. Harry, who lives along Waiyaki Way, says Njuguna&rsquo;s is his local. &ldquo;You can never go wrong with the meat here,&rdquo; he says.

Opened in 1980, Carnivore situated off Langata Road is one of the oldest establishments in Kenya and has maintained its standards since. Anne Wairimu, a journalist, says she usually joins her male colleagues, together with one more female colleague for nyama choma at Road House along Denis Pritt Road. &ldquo;I love their meat, especially their marinated ribs,&rdquo; says Wairimu. She has initiated her girlfriends and on Fridays you are bound to catch them&nbsp; laughing heartily at Road House as they wait for their meat to be served. &ldquo;At times we break the monotony and enjoy a good fry,&rdquo; says Wairimu. &ldquo;Incidentally, beer seems to go down well with some nyama,&rdquo; confesses Alfred.

Out of town drives For a bite of good and affordable meat, Nairobians are known to travel as far as Ole Polos, Kitengela or Kajiado. But with so many nyama choma havens within the city, these trips have reduced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t have to drive all the way,&rdquo; says Alfred. &ldquo;Unless of course we have planned an out-of-town nyama plot,&rdquo; he says. Evidently, there are some meat spots that were favoured by the majority though some people prefer the ones not too far from their offices. Kate and her collegues who work in Upper Hill usually enjoy their meat at Sagret in Milimani. &ldquo;Their meat is tender and the best in town,&rdquo; says Kate. &ldquo;We had our primary school get-together at Sagret last month and everyone loved the meat,&rdquo; she offers. Though she doesn&rsquo;t drink alcohol, she says her friends enjoy Sagret too because the beer is cheap. Ken and Patrick also concur with Kate&rsquo;s sentiments. A stone&rsquo;s throw from the City Centre, Ken praises it for its proximity from his office. &ldquo;I can enjoy a drink as I wait for my meat on my way home,&rdquo; he says. Burma market Dr Kamau, who relocated to the United States, says one of the things he misses in Kenya is the marinated ribs from Annie Oakley&rsquo;s (now Oakley Base), Milimani. &ldquo;I would make my order from the office and pick it on my way home,&rdquo; reminisces Kamau, who lived along State House Road then. Having the phone number of the chef or butcher of their favourite meat joint is not new to Nairobians and a good number do in case they need their meat ready before they arrive. Joseph says he&rsquo;s watching his diet though his cheat days comprise of a good &lsquo;maji maji&rsquo; from Guava in Hurlingham. &ldquo;I usually call in advance because I hate having to wait for my meat,&rdquo; he says. Specialising in meat,&nbsp; Carnivore has become a favourite for both locals and foreigners. Though a little pricey, you are still bound to find a good quorum of clientele coming to enjoy their dinner, which could be telling of the quality of their meat. &ldquo;We usually come here for dinner with our friends and sometimes we have to reserve a table in advance,&rdquo; says Bill, who enjoys their meat. &ldquo;Oh and their duck is to die for,&rdquo; says Anita. On the other hand, Kimani, who lives in Eastlands says his favourite meat joints are Meatland near Avenue Park Estate and Spinners near Taj Mall. &ldquo;You have to taste the meat at Burma,&rdquo; says Kamau. Burma, which is located opposite the City Stadium, is famous for its meat, he says. &ldquo;It is also cheap and you can get a kilo for about Sh500 - Sh600,&rdquo; says Kamau. Sam who works in town is a fan of Q Lounge (formerly Alfajiri), which is located along Maalim Juma Road, off Dennis Pritt Road. &ldquo;I go there specifically for their nyama,&rdquo; he says. Sam also enjoys meat from Road House. Nyama choma lovers are definitely spoilt for choice in Nairobi. The average price at most of the local joints is Sh700 though it could drop by about Sh200 at Burma. &ldquo;If a place is popular for good meat, I tend to trust them more and would rather eat there,&rdquo; says Carol.
