A row is brewing between the county government of Kakamega and Senator Boni Khalwale over campaign billboards. Khalwale, who is seeking to unseat Governor Wycliffe Oparanya in the August 8 polls, has erected two billboards in Kakamega and Mumias towns. But the county has ordered all billboards put up without licences removed within seven days, prompting Khalwale to claim that it is planning to remove his billboards. According to a public notice by the lands, housing, urban areas, and physical planning department, the county will not allow unauthorised posters and advertisements.
