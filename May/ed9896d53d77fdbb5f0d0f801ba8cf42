A section of Maasai elders have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to state the official position on lifting of the caveat on Mau forest. Led by former Transport and Licensing Board Chairman Hassan ole Kamwaro, former Narok County Council Chairman Kelena ole Nchoe and former civil leader Joseph ole Karia, the elders said the community supports the forest&#39;s conservation but would go to court to stop implementation of the caveat. The elders said the community had been puzzled by Deputy President William Ruto&#39;s recent statement that the caveat had been lifted.
