A crackdown on illicit brew by police officers turned tragic when two middle aged men drowned as they dived into Nzoia River to avoid arrest over the weekend. Musa Wanjala and Alex Khisa were walking home from Mois-Bridge where they had gone to buy vegetables when they were allegedly confronted by the officers in Kapkoi sisal village. The two aged 23 and 28, respectively, reportedly dived into the water and unsuccessfully tried to swim across the flooded river to escape arrest. The officers from Kitale police station are said to have suspended the operation after the drowning and drove off with some people they had arrested during the raid. The chairman of Nyumba Kumi initiative, John Kidula said the two men met their deaths while running away from the officers.
