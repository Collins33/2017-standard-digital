Kenya&#39;s chances of hosting the next World Economic Forum for Africa got a major boost yesterday after President Uhuru Kenyatta held a meeting with Founder Klaus Schwab. Both leaders, who are attending the global infrastructure summit in China, met on the sidelines of the conference to deliberate on the matter. &quot;The meeting resolved the international organisation for public-private partnership would send a team to inspect Kenya&#39;s facilities to give a green light for the yearly event, held in May,&quot; said Manoah Esipisu, the President&#39;s Spokesman immediately after the closed-door meeting, ended. Industrialisation Cabinet Secretary Adan Mohammed confirmed Prof Schwab was receptive to Kenya&#39;s bid. &quot;The leaders&#39; meeting centred on Kenya&#39;s bid to host the forum in May, 2018. They discussed the processes and steps taken, which will involve the evaluation of the venues,&quot; said&nbsp;Mohammed. He exuded confidence that soon Kenya will get a positive feedback.
