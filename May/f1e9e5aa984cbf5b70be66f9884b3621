Labour Party of Kenya leader Ababu Namwamba has defended his party&#39;s decision to support the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. He dismissed claims that he has been paid to scuttle the National Super Alliance (NASA) votes in the western Kenya region. In a statement, Namwamba said the party&#39;s main decision-making organ unanimously agreed to support Uhuru&#39;s re-election. He denied claims that he was being used to fight Luhya leaders Moses Wetang&#39;ula and Musalia Mudavadi by supporting the Jubilee Party, arguing that he was exercising his freedom. The Budalang&#39;i lawmaker poured scorn on the NASA principals for claiming that the western Kenya region was the preserve of the Opposition and that the region would vote as a bloc in its favour. &quot;Without a morsel of doubt, we shall deliver some very serious numbers to the UhuRuto ticket. The era of that old politics of balkanising the country into exclusive zones for this or that party is long gone. I am enjoying going against the grain by ensuring NASA doesn&#39;t take power in the August polls,&quot; Namwamba said.

However, the Budalang&#39;i aspirant on an ODM ticket, Raphael Wanjala, maintained that Namwamba was being paid to split the NASA vote.
