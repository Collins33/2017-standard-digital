Joseph Onywera,&nbsp;64, is among the gamblers who have managed to prudently spend their proceeds. The father of three won a Sh20 million jackpot from Betway after placing 13 correct predictions in June last year. And he has lived to the vow he made when he received the dummy check from Betway Country Manager Wanja Gikonyo on June 2, 2016, that he would strive not to &quot;let the money make him stray&quot;. Today, Onywera (left) operates a transport business with a pick-up truck and a 14-seater matatu, which he offers for hire. Those who knew him before and after landing the &#39;blessing&#39; can see the big difference in Onywera&#39;s physical appearance, dress code, and even speech. &quot;I managed to build a house for myself and my sons, connected electricity to my home, and also constructed a modern water well,&quot; said Onywera. Further, he bought a 15-acre parcel of land and built rental houses on his plot in Kisumu town. The former fisherman attributes his discipline to avoiding alcohol and keeping away from bad company. &nbsp;
