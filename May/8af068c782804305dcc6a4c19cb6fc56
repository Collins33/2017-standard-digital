The Constitution of Kenya allows the Executive wing of the Government to establish a system that communicates from top to the lowest levels of our community strata. This system is critical for the efficient functioning of the national government and the success of its programmes and projects. There is no system other than the provincial administration that has been established for this function and the County Commissioner&#39;s post is the coordination point of national government programmes in a county, which is the key implementation unit under the new devolved structure of Government established by the Kenya Constitution 2010. The establishment of the provincial administration has been given legality and anchored into our laws through an Act of parliament and that has taken care of aligning the system to the new devolved structure of government as recommended in the constitution. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Kenya ranks highly in technology education, shows report
