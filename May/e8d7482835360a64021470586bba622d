Parliament has passed a report that may deal a death blow to the political career of former devolution Cabinet Secretary, Anne Waiguru. The lawmakers voted to adopt a report on the multi-billion National Youth Service (NYS) scandal by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). The report recommended that Ms Waiguru, who has been cleared by Jubilee Party to vie for Kirinyaga governor&#39;s seat, be barred from holding public office for her role in the scandal. Also on the firing line are individuals mentioned in connection with the scam, incuding former Planning Principal Secretary Joseph Mang&#39;iti and other senior Devolution ministry officials. The Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo-led committee also recommends punitive action against Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen if he is found culpable in the saga. PAC said Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Governor Patrick Njoroge should be investigated to establish whether he failed or refused to advise the government on abnormal NYS payments.
