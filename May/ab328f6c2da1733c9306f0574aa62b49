A boda boda operator on Thursday night strangled his lover then committed suicide. Samson Obwocha 23, hanged himself moments after killing Vennah Kemunto, a Second Year Kisii University student pursuing Bachelor of Science in Education specialising in Maths and Chemistry. Obwocha is a resident of Nyamage village, less than 100 metres from the institution. He left behind a suicide note in the lady&#39;s room. The suicide note read: &quot;Mum, dad, brothers and sisters, I killed her and myself because I loved her with all my heart but she just made me do it. I am sorry. Bye Bye. Mum I love you&quot;. It is said Obwocha put loud music throughout the night to conceal the murder. However, Vennah&#39;s friend were curious and went to check on her on Friday morning only to find her body neatly covered in her bed. Mr Onchenge Maraga,&nbsp;Obwocha&#39;s father, said his son left home on Thursday evening but his phone was not going through. &quot;When I heard the news, I crossed over to the hostels to confirm the deaths only to see the body of my son hanging in the house. I did not know he was in a relationship with the girl,&quot; said Mr Maraga.
