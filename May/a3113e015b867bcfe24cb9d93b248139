Kenya Airways pretax loss shrank 60.9 percent in the year to end-March to 10.2 billion shillings ($98.84 million), the company said on Thursday. The carrier, which saw losses mount after a slump in Kenyan tourism and an expensive fleet renewal exercise, swung to an operating profit of 897 million shillings from a loss of 4 billion shillings a year earlier.
