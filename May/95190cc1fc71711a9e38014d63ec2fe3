NAIROBI, KENYA: City Hall officials on Wednesday took over management of the Aga Khan Sports Centre over Sh4.7 million rates arrears. The officers erected a signpost&nbsp;and a banner showing the establishment was now under the management of the county government. &ldquo;Tenants in buildings that have been clamped down due to an arrears in rates will now pay rent directly to the county government until the money is recovered,&rdquo; said John Ntoiti, the sub county administrator. Ntoiti added that the sports centre was among the many properties owned by the Aga Khan Foundation which owes the county a total of Sh150m. He said there are hospitals, schools, and car parks under the foundation, but they don&rsquo;t pay rates. Maendeleo House, which also defaulted on rate payment, was spared after it cleared its arrears amounting to Sh450,000
