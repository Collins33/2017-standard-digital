According to Mr Ratemo, the children had gone to church about 500 metres from their home. &ldquo;I was in my second wife&rsquo;s house. As is the norm, my first wife prepared them and then let them go to church. People said this relative caught up with them on the way but he denied it,&rdquo; he said.
