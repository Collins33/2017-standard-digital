Two suspected thugs were on Wednesday night shot dead and three guns recovered from them in Kariobangi South. Police said the two were part of a gang that had been attacking and robbing locals when the alarm was raised, alerting officers on patrol. The officers responded and shot the two as two others escaped on foot. The pistols had four bullets, police said. The bodies were moved to the City Mortuary. Nairobi police boss Japheth Koome said they had intensified police operations in the city to address muggings. &nbsp;He said the mopping up of street families was part of efforts to address the matter. &quot;It is a process that has started to address the issue and we are determined,&quot; he said. Some of the street children have been accused of being behind the attacks. Residents have complained of being robbed by people who walk in groups in residential estates and the city centre. &nbsp;Elsewhere, a two-year-old boy was electrocuted while playing with his&nbsp;friends&nbsp;in Mukuru slums. The boy was picking an object from the ground when he touched a live naked wire. Police said he died instantly.&nbsp;
