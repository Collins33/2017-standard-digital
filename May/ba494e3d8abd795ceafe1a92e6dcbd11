NASA co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula says if they secure power, they will review all contracts the Jubilee Government has signed with other countries. Speaking in Bungoma County Friday, Senator Wetang&rsquo;ula said NASA Government will not allow crippling contracts to continue to hurt Kenyans. &ldquo;I want to put the Jubilee Party on notice that as NASA Government, we will review and abrogate all contracts they have signed with other countries without sufficient justification and those found on fraudulent considerations,&rdquo; Wetang&rsquo;ula said. He went on, &ldquo;As a country, we cannot continue to borrow endlessly even at the disregard of sound advice from international partners like World Bank.&rdquo; He warned President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto to learn to listen to sound advice or risk plunging the country into bankruptcy. At the same time, the Fork Kenya leader warned Jubilee to stop micro-managing the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). &ldquo;While we have confidence in IEBC, we demand that Jubilee stops forthwith interfering with the running of affairs of IEBC, he says. Senator Wetang&rsquo;ula also took swipe at what he called Jubilee&rsquo;s &lsquo;shameless nepotism&rsquo;. &ldquo;We cannot have Ruto question Hon Kalonzo when in fact his underage daughter is a Deputy Ambassador in Rome.
