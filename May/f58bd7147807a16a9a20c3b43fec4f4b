The National Super Alliance (NASA) has planned a major rally in Nairobi today to celebrate clearance of Raila Odinga by the&nbsp;electoral&nbsp;agency to vie for the presidency in the August 8 polls. According to an itinerary released by NASA Nairobi team, the procession will be meeting at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) at 10am as the first stop. Four presidential candidates will be officially submitting their papers to the Independent&nbsp;Electoral&nbsp;and Boundary Commission (IEBC) for clearance. They include Ekuru Aukot of Thirdway Alliance, Abduba Dida of Alliance for Real Change, Raila of Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) and Justus Juma of Justice and Freedom Party. According to a programme released by the IEBC, Raila will be cleared between 11.30am and 12.30pm. Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero, who is in charge of NASA&#39;s city campaign team, described the clearance as a major step to having Raila sworn in as President in August. Other members of the team include lawyer Edwin Sifuna, who is vying for Nairobi Senate seat, Makadara MP aspirant George Aladwa and Woman Representative aspirant Esther Passaris. After clearance, Raila is expected to join the NASA Nairobi team for a tour across four constituencies before holding a rally at Jacaranda grounds in Embakasi East at 2pm. &quot;We will comb every corner of this great county in our humble search for votes to ensure that NASA delivers victory at the presidency,&quot;&nbsp; said Kidero.&nbsp; ALSO READ: IEBC director for ICT sent on compulsory leave over claims of sabotage
