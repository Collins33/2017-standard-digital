The Party of National Unity (PNU) repeated its primaries in the county Sunday as directed by the High Court, as a governor aspirant boycotted the exercise. Former Transport Permanent Secretary Cyrus Njiru, who was battling against Kithinji Kiragu for the party ticket, neither voted nor mobilised his supporters to vote for him. Dr Njiru said PNU did not officially inform him about the date, time or venue of the repeat primaries. &quot;PNU has kept me in the dark yet I am a senior member&quot; he said, adding he did not expect any fairness in the new election as the poll officials he accused of bungling the previous nominations were the same ones conducting the repeat exercise.
