Ronald Mukunza claims to have supplied computers to the defunct Migori County Council way back in 2011. The council paid him part of the money but the remaining amount, a staggering Sh554,000, has never been paid. After the county council metamorphosed into Migori County Government, Mr Mukunza wrote to the able government of Governor Okoth Obado and the now moribund Transition Authority requesting to be paid the money in 2014. &ldquo;We understand the transition that has been taking place throughout the country and we believe now you have settled down,&rdquo; he wrote in 2014. He added: &ldquo;Kindly consider settling this amount as we have been patient all through this time for us to be paid.&rdquo; However, despite his patience, Mr Obado&rsquo;s government is yet to pay Mukunza&rsquo;s firm, Katigum&rsquo;s Enterprises, its monies.

Mr Obado, does your government owe Katigum Enterprises any money and, if so, when are you going to pay up? Mukunza&rsquo;s email is [email&#160;protected]
