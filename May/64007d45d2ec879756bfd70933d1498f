One person died while participating in the police recruitment exercise in Webuye East, Bungoma County. Nepher Wamocho, 27, from Lutacho village collapsed while participating in the physical exercise at Webuye Pan Paper Grounds. Wamocho was rushed to Webuye Sub County Hospital where she succumbed as medics tried to resuscitate her. Police Service Commission Chair, Johnstone Kavuludi, said it was unfortunate that a person had died while trying to get into the service. Kavuludi regretted that medics were not available to provide first aid to the deceased. Speaking after addressing the parents, Kavuludi stated it was sad to lose a Kenyan citizen who was ready to serve her country. &quot;It is an unfortunate incident as she was working hard and tried her best to join the police service,&quot; he said.
