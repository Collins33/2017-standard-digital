Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua&#39;s endorsement by Ukambani elders has caused ripples in the region&#39;s political landscape. A day after over 23,000 Ukambani leaders drawn from Machakos, Makueni, Kitui, Kwale and Taita Taveta counties endorsed Dr Mutua as the spokesperson of the Kamba nation, the governor&#39;s allies praised the development but Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka&#39;s supporters poured cold water on the move. Mutua, the Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader, Sunday said he was inspired by the endorsement and would make a political statement on his anticipated 2022 bid for high office in two weeks after wide consultations. Mutua chose Kitui County, where governor&#39;s aspirant David Musila quit as Wiper party national chairman and accused Kalonzo of favouring Governor Julius Malombe in the recent wiper primaries, as his first campaign stop after Saturday&#39;s endorsement. &quot;I am honoured by the endorsement and want to say that I am driven by the desire to serve the people and not acquire power,&quot; Mutua said Sunday at the African Inland Church (AIC) in Migwani, Mwingi West constituency, Kitui County. He urged the church to pray for him as he consulted about the 2022 bid.

He reiterated his party was neither affiliated to NASA nor Jubilee but would support the re-election of President Kenyatta. But his endorsement appeared to rub Kalonzo&#39;s key allies the wrong way, who saw the move as not only a dishonest attempt by Mutua to diminish Kalonzo&#39;s stab at the presidency in the 2022 polls, but also a &#39;cover up&#39; theory to advance his chances of re-election as governor of Machakos. Saturday&#39;s endorsement ceremony for Mutua, which was filled with pomp and colour, was a coincidental progression of the ongoing political storm ravaging Ukambani&#39;s political scene, which has been compounded by the revolt by outspoken Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama against Wiper party and Kalonzo in particular. During the ceremony, former Machakos Mayor Timothy Kilonzo declared that Dr Mutua should assume the role of the community&#39;s spokesman based on his impressive performance as governor. Mutua, in his acceptance speech, hit out at Wiper party, saying it had nothing to offer to the people of Ukambani. But Kalonzo allies rubbished the endorsement of Mutua, terming it as politically inconsequential.

His bid will appear to challenge Kalonzo&#39;s stab at presidency but the jury is still out on the current storm,&quot; said Kilonzo Jnr. Yatta MP Fancis Mwangangi and his Kathiani counterpart Robert Mbui said Mutua&#39;s endorsement for the 2022 presidency was sparked by phobia for 2017 election. &quot;Mutua has simply panicked over the huge challenge he is facing from Wavinya (Ndeti) because he has sensed that he will be defeated in the gubernatorial race on August 8,&quot; said Mwangangi.
