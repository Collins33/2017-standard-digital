A twisted teenage paedophile exchanged sickening fantasies about newborn babies in text messages with a fellow pervert online - claiming: &quot;I&#39;d rape 10-a-day ha ha&quot;. Alan Gray, 19, fantasised about kidnapping, raping and murdering babies - some of them only &quot;days old&quot; - and accessed almost 20,000 horrific child abuse images of young children and infants. A court heard yesterday that a psychologist claimed he was virtually beyond rehabilitation because his &ldquo;deeply disturbing&rdquo; perversions are so entrenched. The Daily Record reports that he is being sent to the High Court for sentencing &ndash; after a sickened sheriff declared his the worst sexual offences case he has ever heard. Gray&rsquo;s lawyer described his behaviour as &ldquo;abhorrent, appalling brutal and repugnant&rdquo; - and accepted a prison sentence was inevitable. Gray, from Greenock, organised videos of sadistic sexual assaults on babies into folders on his laptop computer.

In one chilling message, he stated: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rape 10-a-day ha ha.&rdquo; Gray &ndash; who began accessing online pornography when he was 13 &ndash; revelled in an online exchange with a fellow pervert on the Kik Messenger app, texting: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d kill 25 newborns a night. No mercy.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just there for us to abuse.&rdquo; In another Kik conversation, he tormented a user who stated that she was 13. The court heard that Gray had 19,884 images - made up of 16,120 still pictures and 3,764 videos. These included 1,864 pictures and 2,254 moving images of category A abuse - the worst level. The age range of the children who were abused was less than a year to 12 years, the court was told. Gray was arrested at home as part of an intelligence-led police cyber crime operation last June. Greenock sheriff Derek Hamilton told Gray: &ldquo;The narration of the images in this case is the worst I have ever heard. &quot;The matter involves you also discussing the sexual abuse, rape and killing of babies. &ldquo;My concern is that the risk of you reoffending is high. &quot;There is a significant risk factor and for that reason I am going to remit you to the High Court for sentencing.&rdquo; Gray &ndash; who admitted his offences &ndash; was remanded in custody.
