Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto has taken charge of the National Super Alliance (NASA) campaigns in the Rift Valley region. Mr Ruto, who is also the Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) party leader, will host his NASA co-principals during tour of Baringo and West Pokot counties starting today. The governor yesterday said today&rsquo;s rallies at Barwessa and Marigat trading centres in Baringo will be the second in a series of a planned two-week meet-the-people tours by NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka. Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangul&rsquo;a and Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi will also be in attendance. Tomorrow, Ruto will lead the NASA team on campaigns in West Pokot County where they will address rallies in Makutano and Kapenguria. Even as he leads Opposition campaigns in the region, Ruto will also be fighting to retain his seat as Bomet governor. He is facing stiff challenge from National Assembly Deputy Speaker and Sotik MP Joyce Laboso who is vying on a Jubilee ticket.
