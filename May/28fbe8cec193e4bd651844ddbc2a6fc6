Traffic in the capital will soon be a thing of the past following the intended introduction of 10 more high-capacity buses. City Shuttle, which currently has four double-carrier buses, yesterday said it would be purchasing an additional 10 in an effort to decongest the city. The buses have a capacity for 130 passengers, with 60 passengers seated and another 70 standing. &ldquo;We are in the process of talking to our financiers to ensure that the high transit buses arrive in the city in the course of the year,&rdquo; said Chris Kamande, City Shuttle&#39;s administrator. Mr Kamande said introduction of the long double-carrier buses in Nairobi had been inspired by their success in cities in England and Nigeria. Four buses &ldquo;The buses carry more people and, therefore, contribute to decongesting the city,&rdquo; he said. Currently, there are four double-carrier buses plying the Kenyatta National Hospital, Kikuyu, Airport and Jogoo Road routes. As a safety measure, the buses have four emergency exits and first aid kits - a legal requirement for every passenger service vehicle. The same cannot however be said of the majority of PSVs in the CBD. Kamande explained that the buses were the first in the city to obtain both a sitting and standing licence from the National Transport and Safety Authority albeit on a trial basis. &ldquo;We introduced the first four buses to see how they would adapt to the city infrastructure and they have adapted well,&rdquo; he said. But matatu driver Bernard Kamau said the buses would drive them out of business. &ldquo;There is no infrastructure to accommodate both the buses and the matatus,&rdquo; said Mr Kamau.
