The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Keriako Tobiko has directed&nbsp;police&nbsp;to drop robbery with violence charge against a man entangled in a dispute over a Sh250 million property. Tobiko&rsquo;s office argued that the evidence produced against one Edward Nzui cannot sustain a robbery charge and instead asks&nbsp;police&nbsp;to pursue assault charge. On 24 October 2016, Nzui and one Jacob Muinde Kilele were charged at the Mavoko Court with violently robbing Maviji Dhaji Gajipara while armed with rungus and iron bars. Last month, Tobiko ordered&nbsp;police&nbsp;to amend the charges to assault. &ldquo;In sum the evidence herein is shaky and&nbsp;policeneed to investigate the ownership of the land and supporting documents to avoid a repeat of the same incident in future as the parties battle out in the civil court,&rdquo; Deputy DPP Jacob Ondari wrote on 6 April 2017. Nzui is an agent of Moonglow Ltd associated with former National Social Security Fund Chairman Samuel Muinde that is claiming a 25-acre land in Mavoko whose ownership dispute is pending before the High Court.

The two firms have both produced title deeds that have been certified as genuine. The only dispute is whether it was a case of double allocation. The title for Shamji Pindoria is dated 1.9.2011 while that of Moonglow is dated 1.5.1994.&nbsp;
