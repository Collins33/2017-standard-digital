The foundation owned by Kalonzo Musyoka claimed the NGO board did not give it a chance to rebut claims of money laundering and operating illegal bank accounts. The High Court has barred the Non-Governmental Organization Coordination Board from de-registering the Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation (KMF). The court has also stopped the Non-Governmental Organization Coordinatiion Board from freezing the bank accounts of the foundation and interfering with its day-to-day operations. Lady Justice Roselyne Aburili issued the orders after KMF through the law firm Musyoka Murambi claimed that the move by the NGO board is in breach of the law as the client was not allowed to answer to the allegations before a decision was made. The application, through an affidavit signed by KMF secretary Kennedy Kalonzo on April 5 and issued on May 8, sought to bar the NGO board from freezing, de-registering and interfering of the normal operations of the organization. &quot;Prohibition, prohibiting the respondent from freezing the applicant&#39;s bank accounts or other howsoever interfering with applicant&#39;s day to day operations&quot; read one of the three orders.
