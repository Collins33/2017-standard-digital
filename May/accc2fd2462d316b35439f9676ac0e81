Councils of elders of two communities in Homa Bay want Nasa presidential flag-bearer Raila Odinga to accommodate independent candidates from Nyanza region. The Luo and Suba councils of Elders said the opposition chief should shun any comments discriminating people who are contesting as independent candidates on tickets of other political parties within NASA. The elders who were led by Homa Bay County Luo Council of Elders Chairman Owili Mwai, Secretary Joram Okola and the Suba council of Elders chairman in Gwassi region Valentine Odhuno expressed concern that the candidates contesting for the seats independently had agreed to support Raila&#39;s presidential bid but he was still discriminating them. Addressing journalists in Homa Bay town, Okola said Raila should give more focus to his presidential ticket rather than county politics across all regions in his strongholds. &quot;What we know is that people in this region are supporting Raila&#39;s presidency. It is therefore wrong for him to go public discriminating against independent candidates yet he needs their votes to win the seat,&quot; said Okola. The elders told Raila to avoid making comments which can cause voter apathy for his presidential bid.

Odhuno challenged the opposition chief to give the people freedom of electing leaders of their choice. &quot;What happened during controversial ODM nomination and this narrative of shunning independent candidates implies that the party is the one electing candidates on behalf of the wananchi. We want this to stop,&quot; said Odhuno. He said being a presidential candidate who needs votes from the common man, Raila is supposed to let the people elect leaders of their choices.
