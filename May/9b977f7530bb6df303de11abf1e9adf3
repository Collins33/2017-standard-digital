NAIROBI, KENYA: The number of corporate deals in Kenya is expected to remain stable despite the impending elections and a subdued economy. According to mergers and acquisitions experts from MMC Law Africa, the country will continue seeing investors pump in money through acquisitions as opposed to previous election periods where they have largely adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Intense competition from global players looking for a piece of emerging markets, increased cash flow and demand for expert and experienced human resource personnel by local firms are among the key drivers of mergers and acquisitions. &ldquo;It is expected that the upward trend on the number of mergers and acquisitions in Kenya and in the region shall continue. However, this is also subject to certain enabling factors such as stability, especially following the General Election that is coming up in August and a friendly regulatory environment,&rdquo; said Bernard Musyoka, partner at MMC Law Africa. Completed transactions The 2007 post-election violence resulted in a dip in mergers and acquisitions in Kenya but the market revived after peaceful polls in 2013.
