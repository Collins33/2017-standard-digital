President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday Turkey could not lift a state of emergency imposed in the aftermath of a failed coup last July until the country was completely calm. &quot;We cannot lift the rule of emergency unless everything reaches peace and welfare,&quot; Erdogan told a meeting of business leaders in Istanbul. He said that parts of Turkey&#39;s southeast and eastern regions, where the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has been fighting a decades-old insurgency, were still flooded with weapons. &quot;At the moment the mountains in the southeast and east are filled with caves, cities have been set up underground filled with ammunition,&quot; Erdogan said.
