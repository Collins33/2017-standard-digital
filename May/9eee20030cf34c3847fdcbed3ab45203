Former Taveta MP Basil Criticos has made a political comeback and will vie for the parliamentary seat in the August election. The former Health assistant minister said he would battle it out with the incumbent MP, Naomi Shaban, on a Kanu ticket. The party supports President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election. He said Shaban is his main opponent in the race. &ldquo;After soul-searching and consultation with my supporters, I have now decided to vie for the Taveta parliamentary seat on a Kanu ticket. I&rsquo;m strong enough to take on Dr Shaban,&rdquo; he told The Standard on phone Thursday. Mr Criticos contested the seat in the last General Election and narrowly lost to Shaban. The MP garnered 6,357 votes against Criticos&rsquo; 6,283 votes, a difference of only 74 votes.&nbsp;
