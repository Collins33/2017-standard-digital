&nbsp; Meru Governor Peter Munya has accused Jubilee of neglecting the county despite residents&#39; overwhelming support in the 2013 elections. Munya, who spoke at Kianjai Methodist Church in Tigania West Tuesday, said the Uhuru Kenyatta administration has not initiated major development projects in the county, as it has done in other regions. &quot;We have been begging the government to help us construct water dams and build roads, but our cries have fallen on deaf ears,&quot; said the governor.&nbsp; Munya, who was accompanied by other members of his Party of National Unity, among them aspiring senator Mugambi Imanyara, Tigania West MP David Karithi, and woman representative aspirant Elizabeth Kailemia, said the county had been sidelined despite its support for the government and the re-election of President Kenyatta. &quot;We have been begging the national government to help us to construct the Thangatha and Kianjuri dams to no avail. Yet we have seen the national government putting aside Sh60 billion for the construction of a dam in Makueni and Sh22 billion in Kericho counties. Why have they neglected us like this?&quot; the governor asked.
