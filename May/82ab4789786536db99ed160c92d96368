Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has dismissed a petition by civil society groups seeking to have him and 19 other aspirants barred from vying for public office. In the petition, the National Integrity Alliance cited the 2015 Gilgil Weighbridge saga where they said the Nandi Hills MP obstructed and harassed legitimate authority. &nbsp;But speaking to The Standard, the MP accused the group of branding him guilty yet the court had not issued its judgement. &quot;These NGOs simply don&#39;t know what to do with their money,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
