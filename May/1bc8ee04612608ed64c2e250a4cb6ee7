A governor aspirant has dismissed former presidential adviser on regional integration Joe Nyaga&#39;s announcement that he will vie for the country&#39;s top seat, saying he does not have support. Kithinji Kiragu said Mr Nyaga&#39;s stab at the presidency was ill-informed, adding that he did not consult enough on his new move. Speaking in Embu town, Mr Kiragu said Nyaga did not even have support from his home county, which is backing Jubilee Party and President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s bid for a second term. He told Nyaga, who was the Mbeere South MP for years, to wait for 2022 because he could not get the votes required to win on August 8.&nbsp;
