At Pavement Food Court and Fryz in Eastleigh&#39;s Section Four, a white size A-4 poster can be seen at the entrance. Though faded, the writings are clear and in bold. &#39;TO OUR ESTEEMED CUSTOMERS FROM 14/4/2017 CHIPS IS NOW Sh80,&#39; it reads. Another eatery, Rangers Ark Caf&eacute; at Kamu House, near Eastleigh&#39;s Section Four main stage, sells chips at Sh100. Previously, the delicacy went for Sh80 while Pavement Food Court was selling it at Sh70, which shows even the city&#39;s famous &#39;grab and go&#39; meals have not been spared by the high cost of living. A spot check by&nbsp;The Standard&nbsp;in Huruma Estate revealed many were turning away from &#39;ugali and&nbsp;nyama&#39; to a mixture of maize and beans (githeri). &quot;It is worse. In my ten years in this business, I have never seen such harsh times. I used to do 60kg or even 70kg a day; now selling 15kg is a miracle,&quot; said Arthur Kimani, who owns a butchery in the area.

It was 5:30pm and she was already done with her day&#39;s job; selling boiled&nbsp;githeri. &quot;This is the meal in this area. My sufurias are empty, I have sold everything. But a month ago I was struggling,&quot; said Eunice. She explained she had even been forced to strategically increase her&nbsp;githeri&nbsp;by at least a kilo and a half - for both maize and beans to - meet the rising demand. &quot;But the price of beans has risen from Sh80 to Sh120 a kilo, which also forced me to reduce the portions,&quot; she said. She uses a plastic tea cup to measure out a Sh30 portion. [email&#160;protected]
