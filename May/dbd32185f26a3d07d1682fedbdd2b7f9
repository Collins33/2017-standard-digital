The National Super Alliance (NASA) has said that it does not consider Rift valley a Jubilee zone and told Deputy President William Ruto to forget the &#39;six-piece suit&#39; voting pattern. NASA officials in Ruto&#39;s home turf said the Deputy President should be prepared for a rude shock in the August polls, arguing that the region was warming up to the Opposition and other parties outside Jubilee. The DP is said to be keen to have the region adopt a &#39;six-piece suit&#39; voting pattern to ensure the Jubilee party has majority representatives at all levels. Independent candidates are however posing a big threat to Jubilee&#39;s supremacy in the region after disgruntled nomination losers decided to go it alone. An ODM official in the region, David Songok, said the party was targeting more than 300,000 votes in Uasin Gishu alone and close to 2.5 million in the former Rift Valley Province. But Nandi Jubilee Senate nominee Kiprotich Cherargei insisted that Rift Valley was a Jubilee stronghold.
