Former Garsen MP Danson Mungatana Friday named Hussein Dado as his running mate as he makes a second stab at the Tana River governor&#39;s seat. Mungatana who is running for the seat on Kenya Patriots Party, said he picked Bare, a teacher by profession, because of his sound track record. Speaking at a rally at Hola, Mungatana also declared that the party will support President Kenyatta&#39;s re-election.&nbsp;
