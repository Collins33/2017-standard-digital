Nairobi scored 19 points on economic activity, 13 on consumer size and 6 points on connectivity. Dakar in Senegal closed the top twenty list. &quot;Outside of the top three, each African city has a unique profile. Some, like Khartoum and Alexandria, are very large markets with many millions of emerging consumers. Others, like Nairobi and Casablanca, are highly connected gateways to their sub-regions and beyond. This reflects the diversity of the continent and the need to examine each city market as a distinct entity,&quot; said Fraym CEO Ben Leo. He added: &quot;Nairobi has successfully positioned itself as a hyper-connected hub, both within East Africa and across the continent. This gives the city an outsized influence despite having a smaller GDP than many other African cities.&quot;
