Police in Eldoret are holding six people found ferrying sandalwood worth Sh3 million to unknown destination. The six, four women and two men, were coming from Nakuru when they were cornered with the consignment along Uganda road. Confirming the incident Eldoret West OCPD Samuel Mutunga said police managed to intercept the vehicles following a tip off from the public. Sandalwood is one of the endangered tree species facing extinction in Kenya. &quot;We did not take chances after receiving a tip off from members of the public that some people were coming into the town, using three vehicles, loaded with sandal wood from Nakuru. We sealed all the routes entering the Central Business District (CBD) which later resulted to the arrest of the six suspects,&quot; Mutunga said. Eldoret West OCPD Samuel Mutunga said the driver of one of the three vehicles sensed danger and disappeared. Uasin Gishu conservator Paul Karanja said it is suspected the sandalwood was on transit to the black market in one of the neighboring countries. &quot;We don&#39;t have sandalwood cases in Uasin Gishu. I think that&#39;s why some dealers like those arrested had taken advantage of passing here, knowing very well that majority of the people and even the police are ignorant about the business,&quot; Karanja said
