The turmoil at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) couldn&#39;t have come at a worse time. Already, there are fears about what the sudden suspension of ICT Director James Muhati and the apparent rift between commissioners and the secretariat over the tender for the printing of ballot papers portends for the August elections. Mr Muhati was suspended over claims that he failed to co-operate in an internal audit process. His role is critical given that the elections are technology-backed. Reports that infighting has delayed a final decision on a restricted tendering after the High Court nullified an earlier award of the Sh2.5 billion tender to Dubai-based firm Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing are equally unsettling. With nearly two months to go, the least the country needs is another push and pull at Anniversary Towers. We have observed before that events following the contested presidential results in the 2007 General Election (where 1,300 people were killed and hundreds of thousands others were displaced) offered sobering lessons: that a mismanaged electoral process leads to death and destruction, and risks sinking a country. To avoid that, all parties in an electoral contest must have confidence in the process if the outcome is to be believed. A contested election says as much about the referee as the contestants. It behoves IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and Ezra Chiloba, the CEO, to get their act together and assure Kenyans that all is well.
