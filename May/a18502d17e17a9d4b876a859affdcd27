Photo by WILLIS AWANDU Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leaders are divided over Opposition chief Raila Odinga&#39;s call not to support independent candidates. While ODM Secretary-General Agnes Zani (Nominated Senator) appeared to downplay the emerging rift, the party&#39;s chairman, John Mbadi, remained adamant that handling independent candidates with kid gloves was tantamount to &#39;killing&#39; democracy. Zani yesterday said the independent candidates who bolted from the party after the primaries are not enemies of the Orange Party. The nominated senator, however, explained that ODM would only stand with party nominees during the campaigns that start on May 28. &quot;Independent candidates are our friends; we cannot say they are our enemies. What we want to explain is that when we go outside there as ODM, we will stand with the party nominees but they (independent candidates) are also ours,&quot; said Zani.

He directed ODM and National Super Alliance (NASA) supporters to vote them out during the August 8 General Election. &quot;We have never said anywhere that we will campaign for them,&quot; said Raila on Sunday. Mbadi argued that the provisions of the Constitution stipulate that a person wishing to contest as an independent candidate should not be a member of a political party. &quot;We are fully aware that the nominations had serious challenges in a number of places. These shortcomings notwithstanding, our supporters must not lose sight of the bigger national agenda at hand,&quot; said Mbadi. He added that the party had made a strategic decision way before the primaries to field candidates in all elective positions, in line with its national stature and the aim of winning the highest number of seats across the country. Mbadi wants ODM supporters to ensure that they back the party&#39;s nominees. And Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo came to the defence of Raila, saying party politics was at the heart of everything in Kenya&#39;s governance structure, which provides for good laws, resource allocation through Parliament, defence of the Constitution, and nominations in county assemblies and Parliament.

We have passed very harmful laws because of tyranny of numbers... In the circumstances, It would not be smart politically for any leader to shoot himself in the foot by not supporting his own party,&quot; said Odhiambo. She said Jubilee was supporting its own candidates, not independents, but welcomed the support of the independents for its presidential candidate. The Mbita lawmaker said she would bring a Political Parties Primaries Bill to Parliament to set up an independent body to conduct party&#39;s nominations. Independent governorship aspirants in Luo Nyanza have embarked on spirited campaigns in defiance of Raila&#39;s call. Yesterday, Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma and Homa Bay governor aspirant Oyugi Magwanga relaunched their campaign for the seats, saying they were ready to upset the ODM nominees. Both candidates received a rapturous welcome from thousands of supporters in separate events as they sought to market themselves as independents. In Kisumu, Ranguma was endorsed by his Kano clan after he lost the party primaries to Senator Anyang&#39; Nyong&#39;o, whom the elders claimed was rigged in by senior ODM officials after he lost the primaries. ALSO READ: I am not a spoiler in race for State House, says Nyagah Onyango Jimlong, an elder who led the endorsement, said his group would &#39;hit the ground running&#39; to campaign for Ranguma in the county. &quot;We respect Raila but we will not heed his call to turn our backs on independent candidates,&quot; said Onyango. Ranguma said he would campaign to consolidate support in all the three constituencies in Nyando. Magwanga has made a pact with a number of independent candidates, including senatorial aspirant Fred Rabongo. The two yesterday asked residents to vote for them on the basis of their track record.&nbsp;
