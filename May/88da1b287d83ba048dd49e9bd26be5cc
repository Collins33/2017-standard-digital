Kenya hopes to reap big from the ongoing conference on international cooperation in Beijing, China. President Uhuru Kenyatta has earned himself a slot at the highest decision-making table at the Belt and Road Forum because of Kenya&rsquo;s robust infrastructure development. The meeting is attended by leaders from 28 countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Transport Cabinet Secretary (CS) James Macharia yesterday expressed optimism that Kenya would bag more deals from China. &ldquo;This is a special forum and it&rsquo;s a privilege for Kenya to be part of the high-level deliberations whose take-home will have far-reaching implications, including the extension of SGR from Nairobi to Kisumu and Malaba,&rdquo; said Macharia. And that is not all. The President and the CS were optimistic they would secure financial and workforce partnerships during the meeting.

We have discussions on the SGR, the Lamu Port, South Sudan, Ethiopia (Lapsset) Transport corridor and others,&rdquo; said the Head of State. Macharia said Kenya hoped to secure funds to dual the Northern and Eastern bypasses and also wants to build the Western bypass from the Nairobi CBD through Ruaka to the Nakuru highway. &ldquo;We intend to walk away with a partnership agreement for the dualling of the Northern and Eastern by-passes. Those of you who have used the Eastern bypass are aware that it&rsquo;s already clogged up,&rdquo; said Macharia on the sidelines of the meeting. President Kenyatta will give a keynote address today and take part in a roundtable discussion on &lsquo;people to people&rsquo; engagement.
