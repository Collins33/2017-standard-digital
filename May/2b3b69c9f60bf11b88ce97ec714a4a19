Nakuru High Court judge Janet Mulwa Tuesday asked the parties - TSC, the retirees, the Attorney General and the Director of Pensions to resolve the matter, failure to which the court would determine it. &quot;This court urges the parties to sit and come up with an amicable solution to this long-standing matter failure to which the court will determine it once and for all,&quot; said Justice Mulwa.
