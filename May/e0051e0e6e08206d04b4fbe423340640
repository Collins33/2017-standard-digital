&nbsp; Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi Governor Amason Kingi has said President Uhuru Kenyatta was using subsidised maize flour to bait voters. Addressing the public at Ngerenya trading centre in Tezo ward on Wednesday, Mr Kingi accused the Jubilee government of failing to stem the high cost of living. He said life would become more unbearable if the President and his deputy William Ruto were re-elected. Kingi urged Kilifi residents to reject the Jubilee government and vote for National Super Alliance (NASA) presidential candidate Raila Odinga on August 8. &quot;President Uhuru Kenyatta did not get any votes here in 2013 and the same will happen in the August elections. He will get nothing because the people of Kilifi know their journey for change will be accomplished by Raila Odinga,&quot; he added.

Kilifi Woman Representative Aisha Jumwa, who accompanied Kingi, said the Government should be investigated with regards to the maize issue, arguing that the speed at which the grain was shipped to Mombasa needed more explanation. She drummed up support for Raila and said he was the best choice for president because he valued devolution.
