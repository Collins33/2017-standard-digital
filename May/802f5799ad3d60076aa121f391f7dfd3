There&#39;s a lot of dating advice out there, and not all of it is particularly useful or relevant. So much so, anyone dipping a toe into that murky pool would be forgiven for wanting to curl up in a dark corner and shut the clamouring out. Part of the problem is &quot;courtship&quot; is a quickly evolving beast with all sorts of ever-changing painful hurdles and potholes to navigate.

As for the men? Interestingly, men are counselled against describing themselves as &quot;curvy&quot; - not fair!
