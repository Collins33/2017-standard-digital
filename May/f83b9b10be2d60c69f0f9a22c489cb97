he Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) has launched a new marketing campaign to woo more South Africans into visiting the country. Dubbed Asambe-e-Kenya, the campaign aims at revving up the numbers with a focus on adventure tourism. Speaking during the launch at continental travel show Indaba in Durban, KTB Regional Marketing Manager Fatma Bashir said South Africa bears a high significance for Kenya owing to its population of 55 million people, with six million of them regular international and regional travellers. &quot;Travel into Kenya from South Africa is 32 per cent business with the balance of 68 per cent on leisure. What we see at this travel show is an opportunity for us to showcase the best that Kenya has to offer to South Africans and the world,&quot; she said. Data from KTB shows an increase in the number of arrivals from the African continent with Uganda, South Africa and Nigeria recording positive growth in 2016. Arrivals from South Africa recorded a 17.8 per increase with 35,926 visitors, up from 30,500 in 2015. &quot;The African market has the prospects to increase our tourism pie,&quot; said Ms Bashir.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Opening up Africa skies key to growing tourism, says CS Balala
