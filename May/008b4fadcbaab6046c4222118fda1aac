Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi has quit President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Jubilee Party and joined the Opposition at the last minute. Maangi said he had listened to mood, feelings and wishes of the people of Kisii and decided rejoin ODM. &quot;I am there leader and I can&#39;t let them walk alone,&quot; said Maangi at a press conference to unveil him at Capitol Hill. Maangi who severed links with ODM about two years ago will now be Governor James Ongwae&#39;s running mate in the August 8 polls. The deputy Governor has been Jubilee&#39;s key point man in Kisii and has more than ten times hosted Deputy President William Ruto in his forays in the region. Maangi was seeking the Jubilee ticket to challenge Ongwae at the ballot but was prevailed upon by the DP to drop his bid in favour of Kisii senator Chris Obure.
