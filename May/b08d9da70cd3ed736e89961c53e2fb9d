Taita-Taveta County residents Thursday scrambled for the Sh90 2 kilogramme maize meal which arrived in the region on Wednesday. But majority of the hungry residents went home empty handed as the cheap maize quickly ran out of stock. Traders interviewed said they had only received a small consignment of the maize meal which could not last longer. &quot;We could not satisfy our customers because we received a small consignment of the cheap maize meal. I had instructed my workers to sell to each customer who visit my shops one packet of the 2 kilogramme maize meal so that many people can get the stuff,&quot; said Chatrles Wachira, a prominent trader in Wundanyi town. Speaking to The Standard, the trader said they were expecting more cheap food as time goes by. &quot;The 2 kg food was marked Sh 90 and you cannot inflate its price,&quot; said Mr Wachira. A survey in Mwatate, Voi and Taveta towns also indicated that the cheap flour ran out of stock. &quot;The suppliers brought a small consignment of the food and people quickly scrambled for it. We are still waiting for more supplies,&quot; said a trader in Voi town. ALSO READ: Hungry Kenyans throng shops to buy cheap unga
