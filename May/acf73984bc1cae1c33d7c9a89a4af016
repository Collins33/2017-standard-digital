Raila Amolo Odinga, 72 years of age, is the main opposition presidential candidate running in the incoming 2017 to 2022 government under the National Super Alliance (NASA). The son of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, the first Kenyan Prime Minister holds degrees from&nbsp;University of Leipzig (philological faculty) and Magdeburg University&nbsp;(Mechanical Engineering). Raila was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Langata&nbsp;in 1992, serving as Minister of Energy from 2001 to 2002. Additionally, he was the Minister of Roads, Public Works, and Housing from 2003 to 2005. Raila Odinga first ran as a presidential contender in the 1997 elections and came third after President Daniel Arap Moi&nbsp;of KANU and Mwai Kibaki&nbsp;of the Democratic Party. &nbsp;In 2007, through the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) he became the main opposition presidential candidate running against incumbent Mwai Kibaki of Party of National Union (PNU). He has been well identified as one of the leading forces behind the democratization process of Kenya, particularly during President Daniel Arap Moi&rsquo;s regime&nbsp;(1978-2002) and the proceeding adoption of the new Constitution (2010) that affirmed a number of formerly neglected fundamental rights. Despite losing his presidential bid, Raila remained a vast influence in the Kenyan political field, holding high numbers evidenced by anti- IEBC demonstrations through the country. Raila&rsquo;s endorsement as the presidential flag bearer of the National Super Alliance&nbsp;(NASA) coalition as its presidential candidate with Kalonzo Musyoka&nbsp;as his running mate on 27th April 2017, will see him battle it out the presidential seat against Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.
