&nbsp; Sixty people were on Saturday afternoon injured in a road accident at Nomotio area along Baragoi-Maralal road in Samburu central sub county. The victims were travelling in a lorry from Nomotio to Ng&#39;ari area, about ten kilometers away for a political rally when the accident occurred. Joseph Longu&#39;on, a victim said the driver lost control when he approached a corner after driving for two kilometers from a place where they had boarded the vehicle. &quot;The driver was speeding and when we approached a sharp corner, the vehicle veered off the road and fell in a ditch,&quot; he said. The injured passengers were rushed to Samburu County Referral hospital with serious injuries where they have been admitted in two wards and receiving treatment.

Lesila said most victims of the accident victims are poor and don&#39;t have NHIF cards urging his village mates to shun following politicians for handouts. &quot;Let politicians look for you at your homes because you are the ones who have votes,&quot; he urged.
