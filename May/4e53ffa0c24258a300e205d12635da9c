The Kenya Revenue Authority has intercepted bhang worth Sh3.74 million at the Malaba border. The bhang, which was seized in two separate incidents, was packed in sacks weighing 254kg and 120kg. The first consignment was packaged in three sacks and packed together with 200 logs in transit to India via the Kilindini port in Mombasa on May 1. &nbsp;&quot;They (customs officers) acted based on the apprehensive nature of the driver as well as an odd smell emanating from the truck,&quot; said KRA officials. &nbsp;On May 3, a second truck ferrying teak logs was impounded after 120kg of bhang was found packed in a similar fashion.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Joshua backed to replicate 'Woods effect'
