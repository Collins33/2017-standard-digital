There are few farmers who can synergise vision, passion and purpose. For with passion, farming has more meaning beyond agronomics. This triad informed the decision to start a&nbsp;Moringa&nbsp;farm for Manfred Schmidt and his wife Jeanne Margaux. Kenya&rsquo;s economy is 80 per cent dependent on agriculture. We are a farming nation. Yet, hardly will you find a farmer in Kenya ecstatic about farming beyond the fact that it is a means to livelihood. And that is what sets Manfred and Jeanne apart. The couple, both expatriates, came to Kenya for vacation about a decade ago. Superfood of superfoods &ldquo;That was the original plan,&rdquo; Manfred says. &ldquo;But now we are here; managing an 8 hectare&nbsp;moringa&nbsp;farm in Msambweni.&rdquo; ALSO READ: Rising food prices heap pain on poor households Manfred first heard about&nbsp;moringa&nbsp;from his driver while vacationing in Kenya. &ldquo;I asked him, &lsquo;What do you take for breakfast?&rsquo;&rdquo; The answer to his question was uninteresting but also thought provoking. &lsquo;I take boiled milk with&nbsp;moringa&nbsp;in it,&rsquo; his driver said.

Then he did what every exhausted, lethargic, wary and bored tourist does a few weeks into a vacation &ndash; drop the conversation and talk about other things that made sense. But then his neighbour, a specialist in herbal medicine, asked him over to her herbal farm. &ldquo;Manfred do you know what this is?&rdquo; he recalls the neighbour asking. &ldquo;It is a&nbsp;moringa&nbsp;tree,&rdquo; the woman answered as Manfred struggled to wrap his head around it. He would repeatedly hear about&nbsp;moringa&nbsp;in people&rsquo;s conversations. ALSO READ: Why maize is a livewire in Kenya His curiosity peaked. He says: &ldquo;I went on the Internet to read more about this mysterious plant. I read research papers that explained the health benefits of&nbsp;moringa. I learnt that&nbsp;moringa&nbsp;was not just a superfood; that it was a superfood of all superfoods.&rdquo; He tried it himself; eating the leaves as vegetables. In two weeks, Manfred says, he was feeling reenergised. The lethargy stopped taunting his joints. His mind felt sharper. And his energy levels peaked again. The routine consumption of&nbsp;Moringa, it seemed, was the shot in the arm that pain killer tablets couldn&rsquo;t provide him. &ldquo;Initially, I created a small firm with a few trees for my personal use,&rdquo; Manfred says. However, Manfred&rsquo;s business instinct kicked in. To him, a retired entrepreneur known back in Germany for his business acumen, it made sense to make&nbsp;moringa&nbsp;available to the rest of the world, and while at it create jobs and make a modest profit. The couple purchased the 8 acre farm in Msambweni specifically to farm&nbsp;moringa: a green paradise, an earshot away from the rumbling ocean waves bouncing off the beach coast. Heavy investment From this paradise Africa&rsquo;s first international&nbsp;moringaproducer has emerged.

Indeed, research has shown that&nbsp;moringa&nbsp;is the mother lode of healthy nutrition. Moringa&nbsp;contains all the nine essential amino acids. Such a profile is only possible with animal based foods. Moringa&nbsp;also contains a plethora of vitamins: vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and calcium. The plant&rsquo;s leaves are bursting with antioxidants. Research has shown that&nbsp;moringa&nbsp;lowers blood sugar, regulates blood pressure, and contains antitumor and anti-inflammatory agents. Simply put,&nbsp;moringa&nbsp;is to healthy living what agriculture is to the Kenyan economy. And Manfred had just discovered it. Moringa&nbsp;grows wild in many parts of Kenya. It was hence astounding for Manfred when he learnt that the local population didn&rsquo;t tap into the tree&rsquo;s benefits. &ldquo;It was right there in many people&rsquo;s backyards. Yet many didn&rsquo;t even know that it could be used as a vegetable,&rdquo; Manfred says. What sets him apart from Kenyans who couldn&rsquo;t commercialise the magical plant? &ldquo;To produce it at the scale at which I produce it you need a lot of money,&rdquo; he says. You can&rsquo;t however deny that he possesses a certain definitive drive. A panoramic view of the couple&rsquo;s farm reveal perfectly spaced plots with green canopy. Being an EPZ, the&nbsp;Moringa&nbsp;firm exports 80 per cent of the processed&nbsp;moringa&nbsp;to US and Europe markets.
