A pigeon was found carrying drugs in a small bag attached to its back in Kuwait, British media reported, quoting a Kuwaiti newspaper.&nbsp;Customs officials captured the bird, found to be carrying 178 pills, near the customs building close to the border with Iraq. The Kuwaiti newspaper al-Rai said the drugs were a form of ketamine, used as an illegal drug. The BBC reported an al-Rai journalist as saying that the customs officials were aware of using pigeons for drug smuggling in the area but this is the first time they&#39;ve caught one of the birds. Birds have been caught in the act more than once previously. Columbia had caught a bird in 2011 wearing a bag containing 40 grams of marijuana apparently in an attempt to smuggle the drugs into prison. In 2015, prison guards in Costa Rica caught a pigeon carrying cocaine and cannabis in a zipped pouch.
