A police imposter &mdash; Joshua Waiganjo &mdash; who is now in jail will know his fate in a vehicle theft case on June 30. Waiganjo, who was presented in court was informed that the judgment was not ready. The man who is serving a five-year jail term after he was convicted for impersonating a police officer had earlier denied stealing the motor vehicle. Waiganjo is said to have committed the offence on December 1, 2009 at Mawanga Trading Centre in the outskirts of Nakuru. He was accused of tampering with the registration number of the car which belongs to Peter Kimani, a businessman.&nbsp;
