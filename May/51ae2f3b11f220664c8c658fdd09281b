Reports that some employers are subjecting their employees to a forced HIV test before they can be hired or promoted are disquieting. This opens stigmatisation, yet discrimination of people infected with HIV and Aids undermines efforts to cultivate inclusivity in our society. Considering that those infected with the virus could be victims of rape; or got infected at birth; or through accidental contamination; or like in the case of doctors, is a workplace hazard, to deny such a person a job or a privilege or even a service on account of their HIV status is insensitive and callous. The World Health Organisation lists HIV and Aids as one of the world&rsquo;s most significant public health challenges, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like Kenya. Yet as a result of recent advances in medicine and access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-positive people now live longer and healthier lives. So real or perceived HIV status should not be a reason to be denied promotion or employment or termination thereof. It is heartening that Public Service Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki has taken measures to ensure that discrimination on account of HIV status in public service is done away with.

The private sector should be encouraged to adapt these measures as well.
