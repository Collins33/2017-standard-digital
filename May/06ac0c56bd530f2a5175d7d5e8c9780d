The Medical Practitioners and Dentists Act does not have enough teeth to punish those who play with other peoples&#39; lives to make money. The punishment is so lenient that one can afford to pay the fine or serve the jail term then get back to the dangerous and illegal business. Section 22 of the Act reads that a person who is arrested practising medicine, surgery or dentistry but is not licensed, shall be guilty of an offence that is liable for a fine of Sh10,000 or spend a term in jail that does not exceed 12 months, or both. In addition, those who use the title &#39;doctor&#39; and are not qualified should be slapped with a fine not exceeding Sh10,000 or jailed for a period that does not exceed two years, or both.

The Kenya Medical Laboratory Technicians and Technologies Board on the other hand arrested more than 50 people who were practising with forged certificates.&nbsp;
