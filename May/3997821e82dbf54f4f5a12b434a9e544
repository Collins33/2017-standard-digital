At least 1.3 million residents are set to benefit from about 700,000 treated mosquito nets in Kisumu County&#39;s Malaria Control Strategy. The county Malaria Control Unit (MCU) last week completed a two-week registration exercise and community health promotion ahead of the distribution. &nbsp;Area MCU coordinator Lilyana Dayo said 1,321,910 people in 266,411 households had been registered in the ongoing anti-malaria campaign and would be issued with the nets. &quot;Every two people in a household will get one treated mosquito net, and we have managed to reach every part of the county,&quot; said Dayo.
