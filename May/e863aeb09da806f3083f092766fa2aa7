Tanzania&rsquo;s central bank said it revoked the business licence of FBME Bank and placed it under liquidation after it was accused by the US government of large-scale money laundering. The central bank took over the management of FBME Bank in July 2014 following a report from the US Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network describing the bank as a &ldquo;primary money laundering concern&rdquo;.
