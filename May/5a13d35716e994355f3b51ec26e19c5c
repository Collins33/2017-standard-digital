Deputy President William Ruto will today (Sunday) pitch tent in Mandera County, where elders hold sway on who wins which political seat. Jubilee Party nominees in the county are facing stiff political competition from the Economic Freedom Party (EFP) candidates, who are being backed by the communities&rsquo; elders in a negotiated democracy arrangement. In the 2013 polls, Mr Ruto&rsquo;s now-defunct United Republican Party (URP) swept majority seats and it would be in his interest to retain the grip through the Jubilee Party. Governor Ali Roba was yesterday in a whirlwind campaign to mobilise Jubilee supporters ahead of Ruto&rsquo;s visit. The DP will use the visit to pitch for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election as well as campaign for Jubilee candidates for various seats. Governor Roba, MPs Mohamed Haji (Banisa), Shaban Issack (Lafey), Mohamud Mohamed (Mandera West), Ethila Mohamed (Woman Rep candidate) and Adan Nooru (Mandera North) yesterday vowed to rally the county to vote for Jubilee candidates from the presidency to the MCA positions. They described EFP candidates as a group of losers who had sensed defeat and were now trying to ride on the influence of the elders&rsquo; council.

This is the only administration that has managed to bring all communities in our county on board,&rdquo; said Roba.&nbsp;
