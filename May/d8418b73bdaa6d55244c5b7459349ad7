Governor Jack Ranguma has said he still hopes the ODM appeals board would hand him the nomination certificate. He said even though the board trashed his statement after the declaration of Senator Anyang&#39; Nyong&#39;o as the winner of the primaries, he was still &quot;optimistic justice will be served&quot;. Ranguma Sunday got a heroic welcome on arrival from Nairobi where he had attended an appeals board hearing. &quot;The appeal process is still on. I am back to consult my supporters on the next move should the verdict favour Nyong&#39;o,&quot; he said.
