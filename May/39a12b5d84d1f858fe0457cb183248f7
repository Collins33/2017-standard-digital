Unknown to many city residents, independent governor aspirant Miguna Miguna has picked a running mate from Murang&#39;a County. Twenty-four-year-old James Gathungu will be the youngest deputy governor should Mr Miguna clinch the coveted seat in the August polls. Popularly known for his political activism in Laikipia University, Mr Gathungu agreed to support Miguna&#39;s bid owing to his manifesto. &quot;Miguna&#39;s manifesto will propel development in the county, which will eventually place the region among top world investment cities,&quot; he said. Fielding questions at his parents&#39; home in Gaichanjiru ward in Murang&#39;a, Gathungu, a bachelor of science (statistics) graduate, said he would support Miguna&#39;s bid based on his integrity and governance background. In 2015, Gathungu was among hardliners who attacked Murang&#39;a Governor Mwangi wa Iria&#39;s administration on issues regarding corruption and bad governance before he was roughed up at General Ihura Stadium on the eve of 2016.

Gathungu chose to champion change in his home county after he realised that the youth remained marginalised and locked out of benefiting from devolution and the Constituency Development Fund. &quot;I have been a close friend of Miguna&#39;s and he has been my mentor since I completed university. That is why I took up the offer,&quot; he said. After he lost narrowly in Gaichanjiru ward during the Jubilee Party primaries, garnering 1,942 votes against the winner Elias Kariuki&#39;s 2,100, Miguna approached him with the running mate offer. He said they had a working structure that would transform the city and cause it to regain its lost glory through improved infrastructure and garbage collection. &quot;Nairobi requires a design to control flood waters mostly by enhancing water harvesting,&quot; he said. &quot;This would also act as a cure to the perennial water shortages.&quot; ALSO READ: No campaigns in areas declared dangerous in Laikipia, Baringo
