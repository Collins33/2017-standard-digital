&nbsp; &nbsp; Panic has gripped Nandi County government following recovery of Sh5.7 million&nbsp;by an anti-corruption team from a private residence linked to a senior official in Eldoret. Six other senior county officials are said to be on the radar of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) as it gathers evidence on corruption at the devolved government. EACC officers who arrested Roads and Infrastructure Chief Officer Alex Buigut on Friday evening also recovered tender documents belonging to Nandi County at his private offices. In an attempt to exonerate themselves, some county officials have been divulging incriminating information to EACC. ALSO READ: One sad story that Kenya shares with S.Africa is corruption &nbsp;
