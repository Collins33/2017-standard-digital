Uasin Gishu Senatorial aspirant Prof. Margaret Kamar (Right) condoles with Kapsoya ward MCA aspirant James Ratemo whose children were abducted and murdered in Eldoret ELDORET, KENYA: The prosecution has sought for ten more days to finalise investigations and place charges against key suspect in the matter in which three children of Kapsoya Ward Member of County Assembly (MCA) aspirant James Ratemo Nyambane were killed. Zachary Omwenga, Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) in Uasin Gishu, who was present in the Chief Magistrate&#39;s Court when Enoch Onsanse the key suspect appeared, asked the court to give them more time to thoroughly investigate the matter before amending charges. On May 17, Onsanse was charged before Chief Magistrate Charles Obulutsa for allegedly abducting Clifford Nyambane (6), Taniy Nyamweya (5) and Glen Ongaki (3) on May 13 from their Kapsoya home as they headed to Church. The court was supposed to give a report about the initial charges but the change of circumstances after it was found that the children were killed, prompted the prosecution to consider amending the charges into murder but only after thorough investigations are conducted.

Some forensic tests also need to be done in Nairobi hence we need more days to conclude the investigations,&quot; said Omwenga. Mr Obulutsa had no objection on the request and rescheduled the matter to June 6, 2017 when the prosecution is expected to place formal charges basing on investigations findings against Onsanse who is Nyambane&#39;s younger brother.
