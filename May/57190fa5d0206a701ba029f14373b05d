Members of the Abagusii community living in the diaspora have petitioned National Super Alliance (Nasa) presidential candidate Raila Odinga to rescind the appointment of Joash Maangi as Kisii Governor James Ongwae&#39;as running mate in the August 8th polls. &quot;On behalf of the NASA diaspora liaison in charge of Raila&#39;s presidential campaign, we hereby request Raila and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM)&nbsp;to consider dropping Maangi, as Ongwae&#39;s running mate,&quot; said Joseph Lister Nyaringo, NASA Diaspora Liaison co-chair, who resides in New Jersey, USA. They want that through collaboration with Ongwae and opinion leaders in Kisii County, an alternative candidate with credibility can be identified to replace Maangi adding that Maangi&#39;s allegiance to the ODM Party and the NASA coalition is questionable. &quot;While we understand that it&#39;s the prerogative of the current Kisii county Governor to appoint his running mate according to his wishes; we as bonafide supporters of ODM party and the entire NASA family will be betrayed should Maangi&#39;s candidature as Ongwae&#39;s deputy be withheld,&quot; Nyaringo said. Nyaringo noted that replacing Maangi will be to the best interest of the Kenya&#39;s leadership development, maturity of political parties as tools for governance, growth in democracy and consistency in leadership across the board. &quot;If we can recall, Maangi&#39;s inconsistency is well captured. His endless trips to Deputy President&#39;s William Ruto&#39;s Sugoi home to declare allegiance to Jubilee party are still fresh in our memories. His dalliance with the current leadership was a slap on the face for the party that sponsored him to office. He cannot therefore be trusted in the ODM fraternity and the larger NASA coalition,&quot; Nyaringo said.

Remember, Maangi has a warm chemistry with Ruto who strives to have as many Jubilee governors as possible for his 2022 presidential bid.&quot;
