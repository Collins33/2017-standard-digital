The GAVI global vaccine alliance said on Friday some 300,000 emergency doses of an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck could be available in case of a large-scale outbreak,&nbsp;after the World Health Organization confirmed a fatal case in Congo. The vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV, was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published last December. A spokesman for the World Health Organization told Reuters on Friday that a person in the Democratic Republic of Congo had died after becoming infected with Ebola - a contagious virus that causes hemorrhagic fever.
