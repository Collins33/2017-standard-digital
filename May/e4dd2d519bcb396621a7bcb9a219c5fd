Kisii Senator Chris Obure and three Jubilee Party MPs will have to wait until Thursday to know the fate of their nominations. The Political Parties Disputes Tribunal barred the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission from accepting their nomination certificates. The barring came even after Jubilee held repeat primaries after the tribunal ordered them for the governor and three parliamentary slots in the county when aspirants filed a petition. Those who filed the petition were governor aspirant Alfred Nyangweso, former chief Mary Ratemo (Bonchari), Ndemo Ong&rsquo;era and Joseph Bogonko, both of Kitutu Chache North, and Kennedy Nyamweya (Bomachoge Chache). The tribunal will rule on the matter on Thursday.&nbsp; ALSO READ: DP William Ruto tours &lsquo;elders zone&rsquo;
