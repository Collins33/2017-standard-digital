The Opposition alliance is keen to ensure that candidates from affiliate parties are elected in order to secure a parliamentary majority in Parliament. National Super Alliance (NASA) leaders Raila Odinga and Musalia Mudavadi are alive to the fact that independent candidates could deny the coalition a majority in the Senate and National Assembly. Consequently, they want their supporters to elect candidates from Orange Democratic Movement, Amani National Congress, Ford Kenya, Wiper Democratic Movement and Chama Cha Mashinani. &#39;&#39;We know some party loyalists and ardent supporters have decided to go it alone. If not checked, their actions could deny us parliamentary strength,&#39;&#39; said Mr Mudavadi. Raila said although he had nothing against independent candidates, he had to show his followers the &quot;right direction&quot;. &quot;Worldwide democracies are guided. The people must be well educated on the consequences of the choices they make,&quot; Raila asserted.

We can&#39;t assume that Raila can become a strong President without surrogates. He needs a strong team behind him,&quot; stressed Mr Orengo.
