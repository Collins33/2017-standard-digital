A powerful car bomb exploded in the center of Afghanistan&#39;s capital on Wednesday, killing at least 80 people, injuring 320. The explosion sent clouds of black smoke into the sky above the presidential palace and foreign embassies, officials said Basir Mujahid, a spokesman for Kabul police, said several people were killed and wounded in the blast near the fortified entrance to the German embassy. &quot;It was a car bomb near the German embassy, but there are several other important compounds and offices near there too. It is hard to say what the exact target is,&quot; Mujahid said. The explosion shattered windows and blew doors off their hinges in houses hundreds of meters away. A public health spokesman said at least 67 wounded people had been taken to hospitals around Kabul. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast. A spokesman for Taliban insurgents said he was gathering information.

U.S. President Donald Trump is due to decide soon on a recommendation to send 3,000 to 5,000 more troops to bolster the small NATO training force and U.S. counter-terrorism mission now totaling just over 10,000. The commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, told a congressional hearing earlier this year that he needed several thousand more troops to help Afghan forces break a &quot;stalemate&quot; with the Taliban.
