Is Teso home of running mates? Three governor aspirants have all picked running mates from Teso region, the backyard of Governor Sospeter Ojaamong. Paul Otuoma (Independent), Dan Barasa of Jubilee Party and Amani National Congress&#39; (ANC) Humphrey Nakitare, opted for running mates from a region with 120,000 registered voters. Mr Ojaamong is likely to retain Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa who hails from Butula Constituency as his running mate. The county is dominated by Luhya and Teso communities and to achieve regional balance, aspirants had to choose their running mates from either of the communities.

Mr Nakitare, a former Kisumu County Secretary and his Jubilee counterpart, Dan Barasa, followed suit. Nakitare has settled on Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) Busia branch Executive Secretary General Moffat Okisai, 39, from Teso South while Barasa has picked former teacher, John Imoite from Teso North. Barasa will officially unveil his deputy on Friday. &quot;Imoite is an accomplished individual who commands fair following in Teso North and with him, I am sure I have the best person to deputise me,&quot; he said. Imoite and Abwaku come from the same ward, Angurai South. Okisai served as a teacher for 15 years before being elected as Kuppet Secretary General in 2015.
