Controversy surrounding Kenyan nominees to the regional assembly deepened Thursday, with an applicant filing a petition in court to stop Parliament from going ahead with the election. Activist Okiya Omtata argued that Parliament has allocated all the nine slots to political parties and locked out independent candidates who also want to serve the country at the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA). &ldquo;Their decision to lock out independent candidates from vying and being elected is contrary to the spirit of the East Africa Community, which says that member States should consider special interest groups in their nomination,&rdquo; said Omtatah. He is seeking orders to stop Parliament from proceeding with debate to elect candidates nominated by Jubilee Party, Orange Democratic Movement, Wiper, and Ford Kenya until the petition is heard and determined. Nine seats Kenya has nine seats at the regional assembly based in Arusha, with the current term of EALA legislators scheduled to expire on June 5.
