Former Cabinet Secretary Samuel Kazungu Kambi has launched a five point agenda for Kilifi County in his bid to unseat Governor Amason Kingi. Kazungu will vie for the governor&#39;s seat on the Coast based KADU-Asili party which is not allied to either the ruling Jubilee Party nor the opposition NASA coalition. Kadu-A, registered in 2006, presents itself as the party for the Coastal people, and is among fringe parties fielding candidates for elective posts in Kilifi County&#39;s seven constituencies. Kambi said President Uhuru Kenyatta was headed for a win in his second term bid but added that he had no problem if NASA&#39;s Raila Odinga wins. Kambi will square it out with Jubilee&#39;s Gideon Mung&#39;aro and Kingi, who have been handed direct nominations by Jubilee and Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) respectively. The former CS&#39;s five point agenda, is on education, infrastructure, food security, health and employment, to be implemented in one year. On education he said all secondary school students in Kilifi will benefit from the county bursary and that modern ECD centers each with eight classrooms will be constructed in each ward. He also pledged to construct 300 kilometers of roads in five years if elected and construct water pans for irrigations to boost food security in the county. And on health, the former CS said his administration will construct a level five hospitals in all the seven constituencies in the county in a bid to bring down the cost of health services. &quot;I call on the Kilifi people regardless of who they support for the presidency not to be blinded by the national politics. The leaders clinging on presidential candidates should be rejected,&quot; he said. Speaking in Mariakani Township, the former Kaloleni MP criticised Kingi&#39;s administration saying it had failed to deliver its promises and was riddled with corruption.
