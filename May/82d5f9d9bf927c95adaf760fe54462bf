A report by World Wide Web Foundation is warning of a worsening&nbsp;online&nbsp;bullying of women in Kenya. In its latest report released in Kisumu last week, the global foundation revealed that one in five Kenyan women have reported&nbsp;online&nbsp;harassment. The report, &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s Rights&nbsp;Online&nbsp;Report Card&rdquo; is petitioning the government to urgently combat&nbsp;onlinegender based violence. &ldquo;The government must ensure women and girls are able to take legal action against perpetrators,&rdquo; the report. The report has also illustrated that women in Kenya were unable to compete and engage men on the Internet because of poverty and high cost of using&nbsp;onlineplatforms. &ldquo;In Nairobi slums, only 20 per cent of women are connected to the Internet compared to 57 per cent of men,&rdquo; the report made public during a training on women for radio journalists on&nbsp;online&nbsp;bullying, said. It adds: &ldquo;Only 25 per cent of female internet users reported having searched the web for important information related to their rights.&rdquo; The report wants the government to help close the gender gap on&nbsp;online&nbsp;usage.
