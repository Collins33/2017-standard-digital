The country&#39;s stability in the run-up to the August 8&nbsp;polls weighed heavily on the nation&#39;s conscience during Thursday&#39;s national prayer breakfast. President Uhuru Kenyatta chose the 15th National Prayer Breakfast - a event meant for prayers for the country - to put a case for tranquility, but also warn that the country faced numerous challenges. &quot;Let us admit, ladies and gentlemen, that we have sometimes fallen short of God&#39;s law. Kenya still has difficulties with corruption. We still have difficulties with leadership. We are still divided among ourselves; we are still divided by religion, by ethnicity and by gender,&quot; said Uhuru. He reminded religious leaders that it was their role to keep the country on the correct moral path. &quot;By and large the leaders of our churches and mosques and temples have kept Kenyans and their leaders on the straight and narrow path. I ask you, once again, to play that role. &quot;Pray for us, and pray for the country. Preach peace and teach us to love God and our country ever more intensely,&quot; he said.

Our political formations are more national on both sides and I am convinced that this election will be better than those we&#39;ve had before,&quot; he said. The comments by the two leaders come in the wake of heightened political campaigns amid fears that the electioneering period will once again bring out the worst in Kenya&#39;s politicians and their overzealous followers. The theme of this year&#39;s event was &#39;Unity and the National Anthem&#39;. It was echoed by various speakers, including the speakers of both Houses, Ekwee Ethuro (Senate) and Justin Muturi (National Assembly). Delivering the keynote address, David Beasley, director general of World Food Programme, emphasised love as Kenyans head to the&nbsp;polls. &quot;We may have our differences but we can still love one another,&quot; he said.
