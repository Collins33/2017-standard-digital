Two men were arrested and seven kilograms of cocaine valued at Sh30 million recovered from their house in Utawala area, Nairobi. Peter Okoth Odongo alias Black and Bradley Juma alias Timmy were arrested in a sting operation following a tip off on their deals. Police described them as narcotics dealers. Officers involved in the operation said they also recovered a Ceska pistol from Okoth&rsquo;s house. The operation came after Juma was arrested in a bus headed for Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on Friday night. Police said the suspect was found ferrying narcotics concealed within his suitcase, gambling on the odds that no one would detect it. &ldquo;Upon interrogation, the suspect volunteered information to the police leading them to Okoth&rsquo;s residence where the second suspect was arrested and more drugs found,&rdquo; police said. The officers found more drugs in a hideout in their toilet. &ldquo;We recovered seven kilograms of white cocaine in the house that we believe was supposed to be trafficked out of the country,&rdquo; said an officer aware of the probe. The suspects were produced in a court at JKIA where police were allowed to hold them for a week as investigations go on. It has since emerged Okoth&rsquo;s crime spree extends beyond Kenyan borders. He is said to have begun his illicit career as a drug mule for Nigerian cartels operating in India where he was a student. Okoth was later deported from India in 2009.
