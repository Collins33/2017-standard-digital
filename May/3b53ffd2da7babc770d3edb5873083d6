Your phone is only as good as the case that&#39;s protecting it. And there is no shortage of brilliant cases to choose from. But we&#39;ve never seen one that doubles as a coffee machine before. That&#39;s the Kickstarter pipe-dream of a company called Mokase, which is advertising: &quot;the first multi-utility phone cover that supplies espresso coffee whenever you want.&quot; If it can raise &pound;63,300 through crowdfunding, the company says it can turn a smartphone into your own personal pocket Starbucks. Unfortunately for those that like a latte with their lithium-ion, the Kickstarter campaign appears to have been suspended. Speaking to International Business Times , the crowdfunding site says that the team behind the concept haven&#39;t been able to produce a prototype that meets their standards.

Moreover, it could heat the liquid up in around eight seconds. The beans themselves come from small Nespresso-style &quot;wafers&quot; that already contain the liquid coffee. You then just feed one of them into the side of the case and heat it up. The Italian company doesn&#39;t go into specifics about how it plans to pull off the case. Instead, it just reassures would-be backers with the following: &quot;The project is in a very advanced phase. We have kept in touch with suppliers, prototyped, tested but the total investment goes beyond our possibility, that&#39;s why we ask your help to complete the undertaking!&quot; Kickstarter hasn&#39;t ruled out the idea completely and has said that Mokase will be allowed back onto the platform once it establishes a sufficient prototype.
