Police said Peter Kioko died after he stepped on a live wire while the third victim was 44 year old Ibrahim Abdirahman who died in Eastleigh. The bodies of the victims were moved to the mortuary. Residents have complained many live wires lie unattended. But officials at Kenya Power blame some of the incidents on illegal power connections. A campaign to discourage residents from making illegal connections are ongoing. Incidents of electrocution are common in most city estates. Police statistics show up to two people die weekly out of electrocution. On the other side, police have urged caution, as the rains are heavy in various parts of the country hence rendering some roads impassable. The meteorological department has predicted there would be heavy rains in the coming days.
