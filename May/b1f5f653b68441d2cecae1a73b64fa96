While handing over the gadgets in Nairobi on Saturday, National Cohesion and Integration Commission chairperson Francis Kaparo also launched a robust elections monitoring programme which will focus on building and enhancing capacity of&nbsp;police&nbsp;to handle hate speech cases, with main focus being on equipping them with skills of dealing with perpetrators.
