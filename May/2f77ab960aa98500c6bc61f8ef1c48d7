Residents of Malaba town are counting losses due to power blackouts. There has been no power in town since Tuesday. Many residents are forced to cross to Uganda to charge their phones and to seek computer services. Willie Omuse, a businessman, said he had suffered losses as his business relies heavily on electricity. Lewis Olinyo, a clearing agent, said his work had been hit as he relies on the internet. &nbsp;He has been seeking internet services in the neighbouring Uganda. Kenya Power officials attributed the outage to a technical hitch, but said they were working round the clock to rectify the problem.&nbsp;
