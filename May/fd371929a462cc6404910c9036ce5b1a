National Bank Harambee Avenue: Photo: Wilberforce Okwiri Kenya&rsquo;s banking sector spent Sh97 billion to pay staff salaries in 2016 despite job cuts, an increase of 10.4 per cent from previous year&rsquo;s Sh87.8 billion, even as move to trim workforce gains momentum. Financial statements of the 40 banks that publicly declared their performance for the year ended December 31, 2016 show that staff costs combined with provisions for non-performing loans to push operating costs up by more than a third. &ldquo;Just six banks- United Bank of Africa, Spire Bank, Jamii Bora Bank, Housing Finance, First Community Bank (FCB) and Bank of Africa (BOA) - managed to reduce staff costs,&rdquo; noted the filings. For BOA, the reduction came even as it announced in January that it was shutting down 12 branches and trimming workforce to concentrate on digital products. In the first quarter ending March 2017, the bank has cut staff cost by Sh17.6 million or 5.7 per cent. With three banks under receivership and unable to declare public their performance, data from the 40 banks show that operating costs rose by 37.6 per cent to Sh257.8 billion. Of the 40 banks, 16 of them had expenditure on staff accounting for between 43 per cent and 71 per cent of the total operating costs.
