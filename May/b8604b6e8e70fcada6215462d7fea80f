The vetting of candidates for the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) will take place next week. The two-day process will be conducted by a joint committee co-chaired by Senate Deputy Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo/Marakwet) and National Assembly Whip Katoo ole Metito (Kajiado South). National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi directed that applicants&#39; names and accompanying documents be submitted to the leaders of the Majority and the Minority in both houses. Muturi said in a statement that party leaders are expected to submit the nomination papers of their candidates. Independent candidates are also required to submit their papers today. &quot;Considering the strict timelines, the matter should be expedited,&quot; said Muturi. The term of the current regional assembly that is based in Arusha, Tanzania, expires in three weeks. Kenya has nine slots in EALA.
