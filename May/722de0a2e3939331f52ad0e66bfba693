Deputy President William Ruto has bashed Opposition presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate, Kalonzo Musyoka, terming them &quot;chief nepotists&quot;. Mr Ruto, who spoke at Friends School Porok Secondary in Kilgoris Thursday, said by Raila proposing his elder brother Oburu Oginga and Kalonzo fronting his son for the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) seats, shows the National Super Alliance (NASA) brigade was out to divide Kenyans along tribal lines. &quot;As Jubilee, we are out to bridge the gap between all communities. We have seen our competitors busy sharing seats among their brothers, sisters and relatives. If these people can propose their brother and son for the post, when will a Maasai or any other group get an opportunity?&quot; posed the DP. Oburu has since has withdrawn his application to the East African Legislative Assembly. Mr Ruto said the NASA team has no moral authority to censure anyone over nepotism. &quot;Nepotism is worse than tribalism. Raila and his team has no capacity to lead this country. Jubilee has bridged the gap between all the Kenyan communities,&quot; he said.

All these have been done by Jubilee in the past four years,&quot; said Ruto. He said starting next year, all learners in day secondary schools will get free education, adding that the Government will also construct 160 vocational training institutes across the country for Form Four dropouts to acquire practical skills. Ruto was hosted by Governor Samuel Tunai and accompanied by a host of legislators.&nbsp;
