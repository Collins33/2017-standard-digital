Senator Peter Mositet has quit Jubilee Party after rejecting the just-concluded party nomination results. Mr Mositet claimed the results favoured a political line-up led by one aspiring governor. Senator Mositet, who was thrown out of a tallying centre in Maasai Technical Training Centre by police last week, termed the primaries as &quot;a sham&quot;. His rival, Philip Mpaayei, was declared winner with 62,067 votes against Mositet&#39;s 52, 022. &nbsp;In a letter addressed to the JP Secretary General Raphael Tuju, and seen by&nbsp;The Standard, Mositet said the primaries were neither free nor fair.
