Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has claimed Deputy President William Ruto is behind his woes after a state agency suspended the operations of his foundation. Mr Kalonzo Wednesday accused the Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) Coordination Board of being used by political forces determined to frustrate him due to his political stand. On Tuesday, the Fazul Mahamed-led board said it had frozen accounts and suspended operations of the Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation after accusing it of engaging in money laundering and operating illegal accounts. Besmirch family And yesterday, the former Vice President dismissed the allegations, saying the same board had cleared his NGO less than a month ago and wondered why it had turned around to accuse him of violating the law while linking the action to the Uhuru Kenyatta-led government. &quot;I am not exonerating the President but I would be very surprised if he would besmirch a family. We know people who are driven by vendetta and it is his (Uhuru&#39;s) Number Two and his people. We know the vendetta people and we will deal with them,&quot; he said.

I won&#39;t be intimidated and if I take a stand, that is final and nothing will shake my resolve to bring the kind of change that the country needs.&quot; Last evening, the DP&#39;s office in a statement denied the allegations saying they &#39;understand Kalonzo Musyoka&#39;s political frustrations&#39; and accused him of looking for scapegoats instead of responding to the allegations. The statement added that Kalonzo should leave the Deputy President out of the matter. &quot;The Deputy President is too busy to waste time on such things. However, we know Musyoka&#39;s statement is meant to serve some political interest. He should respond to specific questions irrespective of who is asking and stop looking for scapegoats. Accountability is not a choice. Musyoka owes it to Kenyans and his donors,&quot; Ruto&#39;s spokesman David Mugonyi said. Kalonzo was last week named as National Super Alliance&#39;s running mate to presidential candidate Raila Odinga. Ruto will be Uhuru&#39;s running mate in the August General Election. The war of words between the two highlights their political rivalries linked to their presidential ambitions after this year&#39;s elections. Should Uhuru win, Ruto hopes to succeed him in 2022 while Kalonzo has struck a deal with Mr Raila that will see Raila serve for only one term if he wins. Powerful individuals Wednesday&nbsp;Kalonzo, who produced a letter dated April 10, 2017 clearing his foundation of any wrongdoing, accused Fazul of being used by powerful individuals. &quot;They have motivated us to fight hard. The same man writes two letters. The country is led by conmen who today write this and tomorrow a gun is put on their head and they write something else. These are state excesses, they must be stopped. If there is any justice left in this country, we will fight even if it&#39;s in corridors of justice for it.&quot; ALSO READ: Opinion: NASA should heed the President&rsquo;s Wise Counsel on its Line-Up Speaking in his office in Karen, Nairobi, Kalonzo defended the organisation, saying it had been involved in charity work in the whole country.He said last year, the foundation sponsored 40 students who were airlifted to Cyprus to study in various academic courses, adding that it was unfortunate someone wanted to stop that work. The Wiper leader said his wife and son had done their best to help the poor. Additional reporting by Nehemiah Okwemba [email&#160;protected]
