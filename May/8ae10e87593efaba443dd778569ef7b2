County Government of Nakuru employees have threatened to go on strike to protest the delay of their April salaries. Kenya County Government Workers Union Secretary General John Ndunda told The Standard there had been no clear communication from county officials on why their pay has been delayed. The more than 5,200 employees should have received their pay by April 30. Mr Ndunda said if the county failed to pay the workers by the end of this week, he would convene an executive meeting and call for a strike on Monday. &ldquo;Employees are frustrated because of delayed pay. If there is no quick solution, we shall go on strike,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The county officials claim there was a delay by the Treasury in remitting funds but how come other counties have already received their pay? I suspect the issue has to do with the just-concluded party primaries,&rdquo; he said. Among those who have not been paid are more than 1,200 healthcare workers. Nurses, under the Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN), said there had been disparities in remitting&nbsp;employees&rsquo; salaries. Nakuru branch Knun Secretary General Syprine Odera said more than 500 employees were yet to get their December pay. Most affected were those attached to Rift Valley Provincial General Hospital. &ldquo;We have not received April pay but we also have a number of nurses who have not been December salaries and allowances,&rdquo; said Mr Odera. Acting Chief Officer of Finance Joseph Ombura however assured that the employees would receive their pay before the end of the week. Mr Ombura said the county could not pay the workers on time as the Treasury had delayed the release of money.
