Patients are being forced to buy drugs from chemists as the county referral hospital grapples with an acute shortage of drugs. Doctors have said the lack of medicine has put the lives of many patients at risk. Local Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) officials said the hospital had not received drugs for a long time. Secretary Ben Otieno claimed the hospital last received drugs in July 2016 despite an influx of patients. &quot;Healthcare providers are also stranded as they don&#39;t have drugs to give patients. The last time drugs were supplied to this facility in sufficient quantities was July last year,&quot; said Dr Otieno. &quot;The drugs got finished months ago, leaving healthcare providers with nothing to offer patients,&quot; he added.

After diagnosis, patients are referred to pharmacies outside the hospital to buy the drugs required for their treatment at the hospital. &quot;We are like policemen out on an operation without guns,&quot; said Otieno. Those who cannot afford the drugs are forced to go without treatment. Buy drugs &quot;Most of us are poor and cannot afford to buy drugs.
