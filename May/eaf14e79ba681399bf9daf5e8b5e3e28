Auctioneers Thursday descended on the State-owned Sunset&nbsp;Hotel&nbsp;over accrued VAT arrears amounting to Sh18 million. The auctioneers, acting for the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), camped at the posh&nbsp;hotel&nbsp;built on the lake shore as the management, led by manager Joseph Oduor, made frantic calls to save the facility that was at one time put up for sale. &quot;This is a small matter but all I can assure you is that we are on it and trying to resolve it with the urgency it deserves. I&#39;m certain we will conclude it in sufficient time. So don&#39;t worry,&quot; Mr Oduor said. But attempts to attach their movable assets was unsuccessful after the manager quickly informed the county authorities tasked with the oversight supervisory role of the&nbsp;hotel&#39;s board. The county government holds 5 per cent shares in the&nbsp;hotel&nbsp;while 95 per cent is owned by Kenya Tourist Development Corporation. Yesterday, after the county authorities got wind of attempts to attach assets belonging to the&nbsp;hotel, Governor Jack Ranguma sent county legal advisor Amos Omollo, who temporarily stopped the auctioneers sent by KRA head office to recover the arrears.
