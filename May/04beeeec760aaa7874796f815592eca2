KERICHO, KENYA: The government is in the process of constructing a Sh770M tea factory under the Tea Research Institute (TRI). Speaking when he toured Kericho County, Livestock Principal Secretary (PS) Dr. Andrew Tuimur said TRI had been amalgamated into Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (Kalro) and they were going to spend Sh370M for the construction of the factory and Sh400M on machinery. TRI dwells with tea research, creation of new varieties of tea and well playing an advisory role to tea farmers on the best farming practices for the cash crop. The TRI&#39;s factory will not only process ordinary tea but will also produce orthodox tea with the aim of allowing more tea lovers to enjoy the health benefits which come with such teas. &quot;The construction of the tea factory is at advanced stage. It is projected to produce its first butch of tea before the year ends or early next financial year,&quot; said Tuimur. During the visit which also included a courtesy call at the County Commissioner&#39;s as well as Governor Paul Chepkwony&#39;s office, the Livestock PS also toured Veterinary Investigation Laboratories, a regional facility which covers nine counties.
