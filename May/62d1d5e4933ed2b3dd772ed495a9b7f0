Lawyer Kaitikei Rotiken will fly the Jubilee Party flag for the Narok North parliamentary race after trouncing his rival in a repeat nomination. Agnes Sailantei Shonko had protested the victory but her petition was dismissed by the Jubilee Party Appeals Tribunal. She went ahead to seek appeal at the Political Parties Tribunal, which ordered a repeat exercise. Mr Rotiken won by a landslide after garnering 20,499 votes against her main challenger&rsquo;s paltry 350 votes. There was confusion over names in the ballot papers but the exercise went on smoothly albeit late. Rotiken&rsquo;s supporters who were waiting for the results with bated breath rose to celebrations after Returning Officer Samson Surum declared him the winner. Rotiken will now face off with the incumbent Moitalel ole Kenta (ODM), Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) candidate Meitamei Ololodabash and his former rivals Nelson Keshei and Agnes Pareiyo, who deserted the party to run as Independent candidates.
