Errol Johnston will remain at the helm of struggling Mumias Sugar Company for another three months. The firm&rsquo;s board of directors said the outgoing chief executive would have to serve the full term of his two-year contract, which expires on July 31, despite advertising for his position earlier this week. Company Corporate Strategy Planning and Communication Manager Moses Owino said in a statement the process of seeking a replacement for the outgoing CEO was on course. He said Mr Johnston had voluntarily opted for a non-extension of his service as the company boss and that the board had accepted his position. &ldquo;However, it is encouraging to note that Errol has accepted to be available thereafter to serve the company in other capacities from time to time, hence Mumias Sugar will make use of his massive experience and expertise in the sugar industry worldwide,&rdquo; said Mr Owino. The statement came after it emerged the company had parted ways with Mr Johnston barely two years after he was brought on board to turn around its dwindling fortunes.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Investors lose billions as Mumias, HomeAfrika trade at Sh0.90
