The National Super Alliance (NASA) is confident of marching to victory in the August 8 General Election, presidential candidate Raila Odinga has said. Raila said the alliance has the numbers to beat President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s Jubilee Party. &quot;We are 10 million man and woman strong. The figures have changed. Demographics have changed substantially, this is going to be a completely different match from the one in 2013,&quot; said Raila in reference to the 19 million registered voters. In an interview with Citizen TV on Thursday night, he said his chances for victory have been boosted by his co-principal Musalia Mudavadi, who went it alone in 2013. &quot;The third presidential candidate in 2013 is now with us in NASA. It is now a two horse race. Remember Mudavadi got over 500,000 and there could have been a run-off had he been with us. We are now 10 million &#39;man&#39; strong. These votes are for NASA and are based on registration.&quot; The ODM leader said the alliance has put in place the necessary machinery to guard against election fraud by ensuring the Constitution is followed in the polls. He said NASA will have a parallel tallying centre and agents in all the 40,200 polling centres across the country.

We have made substantial inroads into Meru and Tharaka/Nithi, which are now swing counties,&quot; he said. &quot;We have moved into the Rift Valley and have made major inroads into Pokot, Marakwet and Keiyo. The Maa areas, which were originally Jubilee strongholds, have tilted to us. We have made major gains than Jubilee,&quot; he said. He termed Nakuru County a key battleground, saying NASA will field candidates for governor, senator and woman representative. &quot;We believe we have the strength to take Nakuru County,&quot; he said. He, however, dismissed questions on whether he will run for the presidency in 2022. &quot;Why don&#39;t you proceed to another topic, this is becoming boring. I have already explained it. I will be the Joshua that will cross with Kenyans to Canaan,&quot; he said.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Raila Odinga: This is my last battle &nbsp;
