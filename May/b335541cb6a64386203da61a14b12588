A Kenyan who won Sh221 million from betting, the biggest in the country&#39;s gambling history, will be unveiled. The lucky winner, whose identity has been kept secret until the official announcement, correctly predicted 14 out of the 17 Mega Jackpot games to win the biggest payout in African football history. A statement from gaming company, SportPesa, said the winner was called shortly after midnight on Sunday and will be revealed at a red-carpet ceremony at Carnivore Restaurant in Nairobi at 10.30am. The winner, who placed Sh200 on two Mega Jackpot picks of Sh100 each realised something monumental was in the offing as soon as the French top flight League 1 clash between Dijon FCO at home to Bordeaux ended 0-0 as guessed. Already assured of a big windfall as a bonus winner, the player could not bear to watch the remaining two games of the week&#39;s jackpot- the North London English Premier League (EPL) derby of Tottenham Hotspur hosting Arsenal and the Italian Serie A clash between Inter Milan and Napoli. Instead the winner left home to join a best friend at a joint in the outskirts of Nairobi.
