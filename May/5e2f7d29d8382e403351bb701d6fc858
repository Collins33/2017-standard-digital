Gold prices fell amid thin trading and the dollar firmed as the chance of a US Government shutdown receded and as stronger equities dampened demand for non-interest paying bullion. Spot gold dropped 0.4 per cent to $1,262.51 per ounce, as of 0900 GMT. US gold futures also eased 0.4 per cent to $1,263.90 an ounce. Many financial markets in Asia and Europe were closed for the Labour Day holiday.
