A woman clings to the windscreen of her husband&#39;s car as he drives off with a woman. The bizarre incident was captured on film as the car drove through busy traffic and the woman screamed at her man from outside on the windscreen. The woman then tried to stop the hubby leaving by climbing on top of the vehicle. However, this did not stop him. The man drove off with a woman in the passenger seat and his wife on the windscreen clinging on for dear life, the Daily Sun reports. The incident occurred on Tsamaya Road, in Mamelodi, Pretoria, South Africa.
