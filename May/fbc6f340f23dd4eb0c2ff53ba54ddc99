Barack Obama has been enjoying some much-deserved &#39;chill&#39; time since he was released from his duties as President of the USA and has mostly been pictured sunbathing and doing watersports with wife Michelle on paradise islands. Obama is still having a good time and this week flew to Scotland - his first ever visit to the country - to give a speech in front of politicians and business leaders at a charity dinner in the capital. He made the most of his time there by going for a round of golf on the world-famous course in St Andrews. But Scottish people are feeling a mixture of shame and rage over a photograph of him being handed a bottle of Irn Bru. You might wonder why are they so angry. Isn&#39;t Irn Bru an iconic Scottish drink, showing off the best of the wonderful country? Well, they gave him the sugar-free version. And Scots are NOT happy.

ALSO READ: Obama's 'wives' who took his succession to court It seems Obama was very complimentary about Scotland after his first visit, saying he believes it has &quot;a lot to offer the world.&quot; And he promised to return. So all is not lost. But maybe next time we should get a few cans of original Irn Bru chilled just in case.
