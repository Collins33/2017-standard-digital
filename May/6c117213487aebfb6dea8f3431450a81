We have casualties,&rdquo; he said. He added they had scaled up operations in the area following renewed attacks by the terrorists in which at least ten people have died in the last week. The incident came a day after Inspector General of police Joseph Boinnet said Al-Shabaab terrorists are under pressure inside Somalia and are escaping to Kenya with an intention to staging attacks. &ldquo;These groups are dispatching operatives into parts of Northern Eastern Region to lay IEDs along the routes used by our security patrols in efforts to frustrate our security operations at the border areas,&rdquo; said Boinnet. He said there is the real risk of local operatives attempting to stage copycat attacks in Kenya following an IED attack in Manchester, UK.
