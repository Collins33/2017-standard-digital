President Uhuru Kenyatta has assured all Jubilee-friendly parties that he will not sideline their candidates. While accepting endorsement by the Frontier Alliance Party (FAP), whose delegates conference resolved to support his re-election, Uhuru said he would allow Kenyans to exercise their right to elect the leaders they want. The President even invited FAP leaders to the Jubilee Party&#39;s national delegates conference where he will be endorsed as the party&#39;s presidential candidate and his deputy William Ruto as his running mate. Speaking when he met the delegates of the party, whose grassroots support is mainly the Northern Kenya counties of Marsabit and Isiolo at a city hotel, Uhuru promised that he would work with them. &quot;Come August 8, we will form the government together with you. We will not forget you and even some of you will be considered for Government positions,&quot; he promised. FAP is led by Marsabit Governor Ukur Yatani, who is facing a challenge from former National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) Chairman Mohammud Ali in his bid to retain the seat. Ali is contesting the seat on a Jubilee ticket.

Uhuru even promised to involve the party&#39;s hierarchy in organising his campaign programme in the area. &nbsp;
