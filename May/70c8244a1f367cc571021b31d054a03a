MOMBASA, KENYA: Tenants at the iconic three-storey Motor Mart building along Moi Avenue in Mombasa County were evicted on Monday after failure to pay rent arrears for years and in preparation for its demolition. The building was condemned for destruction five years ago but the decree has never been carried out. Auctioneers swung into action to execute a court order at Motor Mart building owned by the Kenya Ports Authority [KPA] pension scheme. Among the affected during the eviction is flamboyant Mombasa businessman and Jubilee Party activist John Mburu. The exercise attracted curious onlookers as hired youths carried out the eviction for most part of the day.

He told journalists that the building is one of the oldest but when it was condemned the tenants declined to vacate it despite a court order and several letters to clear their rent arrears. &quot;The aggrieved parties appealed against the court order but it was rejected which resulted in the eviction,&quot; he said. The KPA employee said the authority has plans to demolish the structure which poses danger to the public. Ogola said the court battle had dragged on since 2013 with the court granting an order for the tenants to vacate this year.
