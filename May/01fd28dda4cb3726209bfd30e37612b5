Gunmen believed to be Al-Shabaab militants attacked a village near Mandera Town and killed a chief before abducting two Kenya Police Reserve (KPR), officials said. The gang raided Omar Jillo location, Lafey Sub County in Mandera East, which is about 16 kilometers from Mandera Town on Monday night. Police and locals said the gang shot the chief after raiding his home in the 10 pm incident. North Eastern regional coordinator Mohamud Saleh said two KPR officers are missing after the incident. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if they were abducted or they are hiding. The gang shot randomly hitting the chief in his compound,&rdquo; he said. He said they suspect the gang escaped towards Somalia border which is about seven kilometers away. Saleh said the chief was a year old in his work. ALSO READ: Al Shabaab militants attack Somali army base, killing several soldiers &ldquo;He was a very active chief. He was good in his work and we don&rsquo;t know if that is why he was targeted.&rdquo; Locals said they heard at least six gunshots before the chief was realized to have been fatally wounded. Omar Jillo is among towns in the area under dusk to dawn curfew over insecurity linked to Al-Shabaab terrorists. The other towns are Mandera Town, Arabia, Fino, Lafey Kotulo and Elwak. Witnesses in the area said contingents of security personnel led by Kenya Defence Forces had moved to the area while looking for the attackers. The attackers seem to be roaming in the area freely.
