Jubilee gubernatorial nominee Anne Waiguru has dismissed claims that she won the nominations unfairly. Ms Waiguru told off the losers, who include the incumbent, Joseph Ndathi, that she would still beat them if the nominations were repeated or the votes recounted. She said she is ready to counter the claims by Mr Ndathi and Mr Gacoki Gitari when they meet before the Jubilee disputes tribunal this morning, where the two are expected to table evidence of alleged malpractices during last Monday&#39;s nominations. &quot;The landslide win where I garnered 100,632 votes against Gitari&#39;s 46,678 and Ndathi&#39;s 17,085 is enough evidence that Wanjiku has spoken and I will beat them again and again should the vote be repeated,&quot; she said. Her running mate, Peter Ndambiri, said their lawyers are ready to defend their position before the tribunal. &quot;We beat them even without votes from Mwea. That is why I am wondering why they are crying. I think they should join us because even if they were to run as independent candidates, we&#39;d still beat them,&quot; said Ndambiri.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Governor Ndathi refuses to concede defeat in Kirinyaga Jubilee nominations
