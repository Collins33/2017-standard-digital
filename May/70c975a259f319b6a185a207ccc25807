Tullow Oil has reported a new oil find in a recently sunk well in Turkana&rsquo;s South Lokichar area. The firm said it had encountered substantial amounts of oil in the Emekuya-1 well, raising hopes that the basin might have more than the 750 million barrels of recoverable oil earlier indicated. It had said the estimated amount of recoverable resources could reach a billion barrels with more drilling and testing. Emekuya-1 is an appraisal well that aimed at establishing how further oil already discovered in other wells extended. Tullow said the well in block 13T had encountered 75 metres of net oil pay in two zones. Net oil pay refers to the continuous interval of oil in the well. &ldquo;The Emekuya-1 exploratory appraisal well has made an important discovery in the northern part of the South Lokichar Basin.

Tullow has now drilled four wells in the area since it resumed exploration in December after a lull following decline in oil prices that saw investments into the upstream sector slow down.&nbsp;
