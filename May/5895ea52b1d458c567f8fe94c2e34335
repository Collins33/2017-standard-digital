Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma has launched a scathing attack on ODM as he officially rolled out a bid to defend his seat as an independent candidate. Mr Ranguma, who spoke in Kisumu after a long silence, described the Orange party as lacking democracy after it handed his main challenger Senator Anyang&#39; Nyong&#39;o the nomination certificate, disregarding credibility queries raised by both the party&#39;s dispute resolution tribunal and the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal over conflicting results. He hit out at the party&#39;s&nbsp;National Election Board for watering down gains made in promoting internal democracy after &quot;bungling&quot; the April 24 primaries. Ranguma said naming Nyong&#39;o as its governorship nominee amid controversies was in sharp contrast to ODM&#39;s push for credible national polls and commitment to promoting internal democracy.

She is still there,&quot; he said in response to queries on who his running mate would be. Ranguma will now face Prof Nyong&#39;o on August 8, in what is being billed as a battle of titans. The governor said protests by a section of the aspirants that the officials were cronies of Nyong&#39;o and senatorial nominee Fred Outa (Nyando MP) were ignored, despite a court order directing that changes be preferred. Ranguma said although he had been rigged out, he would support Raila Odinga&#39;s presidential bid as this &quot;is his golden chance in rising to the throne to fulfil pledges he has for long made to Kenya&quot;. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Thousands converge at Kasarani to endorse Raila for presidential race
