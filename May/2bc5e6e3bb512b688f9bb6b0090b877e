A 12-year-old boy who claimed to have been directed by a stranger to stab his girlfriend has been found guilty of murder. The Standard Three pupil from Kibuyu village in Magumu was found guilty of stabbing his classmate, Mary Wairimu, 11, to death on July 5, 2016, by High Court judge Christine Meoli. The boy denied the charge. Sentencing was set for May 31 after the judge received a report from the Kinangop probation officer. Ms Meoli directed that the minor, represented by lawyer Francis Mburu, should be held at Engineer Police Station. Court documents revealed that the boy said a stranger had directed him to stab the girl, whom he alleged was his girlfriend. He claimed a tall man with a panga and a shiny knife approached him while he was having sexual intercourse with the girl and ordered him to stab her several times. The boy then went to the deceased&#39;s sister and confessed what he had done. Meanwhile, a 55-year-old man has been sentenced to life imprisonment after he was found guilty of defiling his 13-year-old daughter in Maella village one year ago.
