Senator Johnstone Muthama&rsquo;s first wife Agnes Kavindu will contest for the Machakos Woman Representative seat in the August 8 General Election. She is among Jubilee Party candidates who were issued with nomination certificates in Machakos Monday morning. Kavindu&#39;s entry into elective politics has triggered a new wave of political excitement, given the Senator had been at the center of the region&#39;s political storm pitting him against Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka. She will fight it out with other aspirants, Jane Cosmas Ndeti (CCU), Francisca Mutinda (Maendeleo Chap Chap), Joyce Kamene (Wiper), Rita Ndunge (Independent) and the incumbent Susan Musyoka (Independent). Kavindu, who interacted jovially with her fellow nominees, said she was ready to represent women and the special groups of Machakos at the National Assembly if elected. &ldquo;I want to thank the Jubilee team for giving me this opportunity. I promise to deliver in Jesus name. I am grateful to Jubilee Party for choosing women and standing with them and I know the women of Machakos will stand with me,&rdquo; she said upon being handed her nomination certificate by party&#39;s regional coordinator Susan Maina.

We will catch up at a later date,&quot; she said before being driven away. Others who were issued with Jubilee Party nomination certificates include parliamentary aspirants Rose Wambua (Kangundo), Thomas Musau (Matungulu), and Kalembe Ndile (Mavoko). The Machakos Senator last week quit the Wiper party and announced that he would not defend his seat in the upcoming elections.
