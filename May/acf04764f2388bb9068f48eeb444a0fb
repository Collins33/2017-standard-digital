Tanzania will enforce a new rule requiring mining companies to list on its bourse by August, President John Magufuli said, as part of measures aimed at increasing transparency and spreading wealth from the country&rsquo;s natural resources. Major foreign-owned mining companies in Tanzania that will be affected by the requirement to list on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange include Acacia Mining, AngloGold Ashanti and Petra Diamonds. &ldquo;By listing these companies on the stock exchange, we will be able to monitor how much (revenue) they actually get,&rdquo; Magufuli said in a television programme aired by local stations late on Tuesday. The programme produced by the president&rsquo;s office featured comments made by Magufuli during talks with local business leaders on May 6. The government issued regulations last year requiring holders of special mining licences to sell a 30 percent stake in their companies via an initial public offering within two years. The mining ministry amended the rules in February and set a new listing deadline of Aug. 23. Tanzania is Africa&rsquo;s fourth-biggest gold producer and also has vast deposits of coal, uranium and precious gemstones. Magufuli said he hoped the IPOs would bring more transparency and offer the public a share of the mining industry&rsquo;s profits. Since coming into office in November 2015 Magufuli has targeted large companies, in a crackdown on tax evasion. ALSO READ: A man on the run: I survived death twice, they still want to kill me
