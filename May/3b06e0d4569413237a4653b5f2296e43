The case involving a 28-year-old man accused of masquerading as a doctor at Kapsabet County Referral Hospital for months resumes next month. Ronald Melly is facing charges in the Kibera Magistrates Court on claims of impersonating a medical doctor. In the second charge of forgery, it was claimed that he had forged academic certificates to enable him to practice medicine. Mr Melly, who &#39;treated&#39; patients in Kapsabet and at the Meteitei sub-county hospital, was arrested when he applied to be recognised by the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board; the dates on his papers did not tally. County records indicate that he had actually conducted eight surgeries and it was claimed that they were successful.

Mr Waweru told Senior Principal Magistrate Elizabeth Juma the accused did not feature on the university&#39;s records as one who successfully completed their studies and graduated in 2014 and 2015. The registrar produced the graduation lists for the two years to support his testimony that the man arrested for performing surgery on patients in Nandi County without qualifications never graduated from the university. The court heard that a further scrutiny of the School of Medicine records showed that he never attended a medicine class. It is claimed that Melly forged his qualification papers. The documents, among them an internship letter, indicated that he had completed training but the hospital where he claimed to have been attached disowned the letter (dated March 31, 2016), saying it was not genuine. The case will continue on June 21.&nbsp; ALSO READ: How fake papers bail out suspects
