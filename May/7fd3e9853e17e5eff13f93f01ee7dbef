Workers at the Pyrethrum Processing Company have demanded a forensic audit of their employer&#39;s property. The demand follows several reports of mismanagement and failure to implement the 2014 collective bargaining agreement. Speaking during demonstrations at the company offices at Industrial Area yesterday, the workers demanded an overhaul of the management system. They said this was the main reason the revival of the pyrethrum industry in the country had stalled. &quot;Mismanagement of the company&#39;s resources by top managers is the main reason why things are rapidly falling apart,&quot; said George Onyango, a representative from Kenya Chemical Workers Union. &quot;The MD himself has turned down dialogue requests from workers and farmers who want to revive the industry.&quot; ALSO READ: The increase of prostitution in Nairobi estates Mr Onyango said an extensive audit of the company&#39;s accounts and property was urgently needed to salvage the industry. The workers, who vowed to stay away until the issues were resolved, blamed the management for failing to review their basic salaries and offer them medical and travelling allowances. &quot;We do not get any allowances, not even for working extra hours although it is stipulated in the agreement that we should be paid,&quot; said Willis Omolo.
