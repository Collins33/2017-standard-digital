Deputy President William Ruto Sunday told off Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto for asking the Kipsigis to join the Opposition and for allegedly opposing Government projects in the county. Mr Ruto, who was in Narok, also dismissed the National Super Alliance (NASA), terming it a power-hungry outfit with no agenda for the nation. The DP said Mr Ruto, NASA&#39;s fifth principal, was out to divide the Kalenjin community by opposing development projects. &quot;What kind of a leader opposes every development that goes to the community? Why is it that when we propose to do a road he rubbishes it, saying it won&#39;t happen?&quot; Mr Ruto asked in Kalenjin. He said the national government had done 250km of roads in Bomet, with 40km already tarmacked. The DP said Raila Odinga caused a lot of misery to the community during the evictions.

Ruto, who also announced the lifting of the Mau forest caveat, said the Government has allocated Sh100 million to rebuild 15 schools destroyed during the evictions.
