There was Panic in a Church in Thika after an explosive device was discovered abandoned by unknown people within the compound. The incident brought to a halt normal operations at the usually busy Christian Church International in&nbsp;Makongeni. Staff members and guests present as well as sand sellers normally stationed near the church scampered for safety when word went round that there was a&nbsp;bomb&nbsp;in the church. A worker in the church said that one of his colleagues stumbled on the suspicious device and&nbsp;alerted other workers. &quot;Some of my colleagues even innocently picked it and started arguing about its identity until one of us&nbsp;warned them of the danger,&quot; he said. &nbsp;The workers then took the device outside the church premises and alerted police form the nearby Makongeni police station who confirmed that it was an improvised explosive device (IED).
