Former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru has asked the court to lift orders requiring her to stop commenting on the National Youth Service (NYS) scam in public. The former CS urged the court to allow her to freely speak about the scam, noting that the orders on the Sh 1.6 billion scandal were infringing on her rights. The orders were issued by Principal Magistrate David Mburu after Paul Kihara, a suspect in the NYS saga, sued Waigurur for defamation. Kihara claimed that Waiguru was using the NYS scandal to gain political mileage. But Waiguru appealed, arguing that the decision by the lower court was also against her right to comment on public issues.
