Female Genital Mutilation, a cruel practice with no known benefit is banned in Kenya. But somehow, Kenya is among countries in the world where nearly 4 million girls undergo various forms of FGM including infibulation, hurtful pricking and incision of genitals to less severe ones commnly referred to as herbal treatment. Efforts to eradicate the practice that is rooted in age-old tradition, have come up against many challenges. Ending the practice, as such, will take time. Experts have observed that talking to the people into seeing the negative side of the practice is more effective than employing force like, rounding up villagers and locking them away in police stations. Women who have gone through the rite experience difficulties during childbirth besides other medical complications like kidney infections that often lead to kidney failure and at times, death. Until now, few people were aware that restorative surgery could be applied to reverse the damage caused by FGM. For those who have gone through the traumatic experience, this is a great breakthrough. A United States gynaecologist, pairing up with a Kenyan plastic, reconstructive and aesthetic surgeon are helping women regain their lost esteem at Karen Hospital. The operations, though costly, offer hope to the victims who usually are poor and mostly below consent age. Hopefully, the national and county governments will be persuaded enough to lend a helping hand.
