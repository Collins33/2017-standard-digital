Campaigners of Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire have thrown their weight behind management consultant Kithinji Kiragu in his quest for the governor&rsquo;s seat. At the weekend, the legislator&rsquo;s campaigners, led by Jane Waroga, her two sisters Grace and Triza and her brother Ireri, endorsed Kiragu and vowed to vigorously campaign for him. Mbarire was absent at the politically-significant meeting held at Mwenendega grounds near Runyenjes town but Mr Kiragu revealed the MP was in the US on official duties. The legislator&rsquo;s personal assistant, Patrick Ndwiga, did not attend the meeting, saying they were convinced their support would guarantee Kiragu a landslide win. Mbarire lost in the Jubilee primaries to Governor Martin Wambora when she clinched 43,509 votes against his 60,634. Her supporters hailed Kiragu&rsquo;s decision to decamp from Jubilee to Party of National Unity ahead of the primaries.
