A stranger in Kahawa Wendani may be forgiven for thinking the place is an extension of Kenyatta University, which is 2km away. It is, after all, a choice accommodation hub for students - many settle for bedsitters or one-bedroom flats. And thanks to its proximity to the Thika Super Highway, Kahawa Wendani is also an ideal residential area for many city residents.
