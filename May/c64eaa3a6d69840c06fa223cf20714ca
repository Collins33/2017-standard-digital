In the second count, he is accused of creating disturbance in a manner likely to cause a breach of peace by shouting and demanding for an explanation for being barred from vying as an independent presidential candidate. The court was also informed that the aspirant damaged one internet socket, one air conditioner machine and door all valued at Sh30,000. Through lawyer Dedan Wachira, the accused sought a lenient cash bail. &ldquo;The accused is not a flight risk and is a serious Kenyan,&rdquo; said Mr Wachira. He said that the presentation process is still ongoing and the accused should be released so that he can appear before the High Court to challenge the decision by IEBC. He said High Court Judge George Odunga issued the order to have the accused allowed to present nomination papers to the IEBC.
