Jubilee officials have accused the party&#39;s secretariat of running it down. During a meeting in Murang&#39;a, officials from 11 counties demanded that they be involved in President Uhuru&#39;s re-election campaign and accused the&nbsp;Tuju-led secretariat of sidelining them during last month&#39;s party nominations. They claimed that the party had collected millions of shillings from aspirants but was unable to pay officials and service providers. The officials also accused the secretariat of bungling mass voter registration. &quot;Officials should streamline the mess at the party and ensure there is flow of information,&quot; said the group&#39;s chairman, Al Haji Mwendia.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Fresh dispute over EALA nominees
