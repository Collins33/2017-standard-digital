Hiring firm BrighterMonday has introduced an improved product for employers to help streamline the hiring process, which cuts time spent by 40 per cent. Building on the company&#39;s database of job seeker profiles, the Employer Centre online tool makes it faster and easier to post job ads. Employers can then reject, review, shortlist, offer and hire candidates - solving the issue of having to sort through too many applications for open positions. The company said the tool was a result of lengthy market research and piloting. &quot;We surveyed employers across East Africa to better understand their pain points,&quot; said BrighterMonday Product Manager James Lawrence. &quot;Our new employer centre solves these challenges.&quot;&nbsp;
