A case in which the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) wants Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho jailed for contempt of court over the demolition of a fence put up around 22 acres in Bombolulu has been withdrawn. &nbsp;The withdrawal came after parties in the suit agreed to focus on the main application. The proceedings were withdrawn after Mr Joho&#39;s lawyer, Lucy Momanyi, said both the governor and KBC had agreed on the matter. &nbsp;&quot;We want the main application to be heard to determine who is the owner of the plot in question,&quot; said Ms Momanyi.
