This follows a High Court order&nbsp;that the party conduct the elections at the contested centres. The centres are Oma Primary School, God Oloo Primary School, Koga Primary School, Mikuyu Primary School, Miriya Primary School, Kiembe Primary School and Nyakiya Primary School. Raila Odinga&rsquo;s former aide Caroli Omondi had obtained an order stopping the primaries that were called for by the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal. OMONDI: OPPONENT &#39;FAVOURED&#39; Mr Omondi had argued that the tribunal ruling favoured his opponent, John Mbadi, who is also ODM national chairman. But on Tuesday, the court upheld the tribunal&rsquo;s ruling, prompting the ODM National Elections Board to order the elections.

MBADI: FAIR WIN The judge also rejected the argument by Mr Omondi&rsquo;s lawyers that the court lacks the powers to entertain the appeal, to which she said, &ldquo;The High Court has unfettered jurisdiction to adjudicate over any matter.&rdquo; Elections board chairperson Judy Pareno, in a statement Tuesday, said new balloting will be held on Wednesday, May 10, from 6am to 5pm. Mr Mbadi was declared winner with 12,365 votes against Mr Omondi&rsquo;s 11,597 in the April 24 primaries. But Mr Omondi challenged the results and asked for the reconciliation of the aggregate results, which would make &ldquo;me the winner of the nominations.&rdquo; ALSO READ: Jakoyo, Gumbo warn of a rebellion against ODM in Nyanza Mr Mbadi, however, says he won the elections fairly and accused his rival of derailing his course.
