&nbsp; &nbsp; Health experts have raised alarm over the rising cases of hypertension among people living with HIV and Aids in Homa Bay and Kisumu Counties. They say hypertension which result into sudden deaths has become a common opportunistic disease affecting those living with the Virus. To help prevent deaths resulting from the condition, a group of Non-Governmental organisations in collaboration with the Government of Kenya have launched the integrated project known as Healthy Hearts Africa at Atela Health Center, Rachuonyo East Sub County in Homa Bay. The organisations including AstraZeneca, PATH and PEPFAR have partnered in engaging community health workers who offer the services to the community. The integrated programme is aimed at eradicating hypertension which causes sudden deaths especially among HIV positive persons. Speaking during the launch of the program on Tuesday, AstraZeneca Senior Director Ashling Mulvaney and the organisation Chief Compliance Officer Katarina Agemborg said a number of HIV positive persons are prone to hypertension. Mulvaney said the programme involves testing people for hypertension and referring them for medication. &quot;Many people who suffer from HIV are vulnerable to contracting hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases,&quot; said Mulvaney. She expressed concern that there are many people who unknowingly suffer from hypertension.
