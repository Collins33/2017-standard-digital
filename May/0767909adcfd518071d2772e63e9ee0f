Kenya will acquire a patrol vessel worth Sh3.6 billion to secure the country&#39;s exclusive economic zone of the Indian Ocean. Speaking at the Kenya Marine Fisheries Research Institute headquarters in Mkomani, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett said the inspection of the vessel will be done next week before it is finally delivered to Kenya. The CS met staff at the institute led by the director, Prof James Njiru. &#39;&#39;The next frontier in fully exploiting natural resources as we strive for food self-sufficiency is the blue economy. &nbsp;The Jubilee administration has taken this seriously and has restructured the ministry to include the blue economy,&#39;&#39; he said.&nbsp;
