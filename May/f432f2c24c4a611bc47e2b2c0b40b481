&nbsp; Many women in Central and South Rift failed to clinch party tickets in the recent party primaries. This means county governments may not meet the two-thirds gender rule in the composition of county assemblies after major political parties failed to ensure that women won tickets for ward representative seats. In Kericho, Laikipia, and Narok counties, not a single woman won a member of the county assembly ticket in the Jubilee Party (JP) primaries. According to an analysis carried out by The Standard, the JP nominations in Nakuru County produced only three women out of the hundreds who contested. Jane Ngugi who represented Gilgil ward in the inaugural assembly, clinched the ticket while Rose Chepkoech floored six men to win the party ticket for Kiptagich ward.
