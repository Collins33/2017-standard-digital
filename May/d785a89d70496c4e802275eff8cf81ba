Police&nbsp;have shot dead three youths suspected to be members of the dreaded Wakali Kwaza gang in Kisauni, sparking protests from human rights activists and locals. Mohamed Ibrahim Shee, Babu Mustafa Sheti and Juma were gunned down on Wednesday night at Bakarani area of Kisani in Mombasa. Yesterday, human rights activists said two more unidentified bodies of youths killed by the&nbsp;police&nbsp;in Nyali were lying at the Coast General Hospital mortuary. Kisauni deputy OCPD Walter Abondo said the three were members of the gang that has been terrorising the public in Kisauni and Nyali areas. Abondo said only three youths were killed but did not explain the circumstances under which they were shot dead after their families said the suspects were first arrested. At the Coast General Hospital mortuary, families of the suspects and officials of human rights body HAKI Africa described the incident as extra-judicial killing and demanded an investigation. Ibrahim&rsquo;s widow Asha Farid said she was first informed that her husband had been arrested by the&nbsp;police&nbsp;before she was later informed he had been killed. &ldquo;If he was a criminal, why didn&rsquo;t they take him to court? Why arrest him and then kill him,&rdquo; Farid, who had been married to Ibrahim for two years, asked. Haki Africa official Francis Auma said he counted five bodies and that two that were taken to the mortuary yesterday morning had not been identified.
