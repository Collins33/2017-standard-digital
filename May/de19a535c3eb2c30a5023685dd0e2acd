KISUMU, KENYA: High Court Judge Justice Daniel Majanja has extended orders seeking to block Kisumu County government from interviewing, recruiting or hiring new City Board, ahead of August 8 Polls. He gave the feuding parties up to 28 July to file substantive claims to argue for or against the plans to constitute the County City Board of Management. He also gave a seven day window period to file. Part of the overriding fear cited&nbsp; by the complaint, Mr&nbsp; David&nbsp; Owino&nbsp; in his affidavit is that, Ranguma could allegedly plant his people at the city board who will be protected by the legal sanctity to be in office for four years. The city board is&nbsp;supposed to be in charge of day today running of the city, including overseeing garbage and revenue collections among others. But if Ranguma, wins his team will help him to deliver. It is against the backdrop of these fears that one of Nyongo&#39;s leutants David Owino rushed to the law Courts last week and successfully obtained exparte orders barring Ranguma from hiring the city board.
