The secret rules which Facebook bosses use to decide what its two billion users can post on the site are revealed for the first time. The Guardian newspaper claims to have seen more than 100 internal training manuals, spreadsheets and flowcharts which give insight into what Facebook deems is or is not acceptable on issues of violence, hate speech, terrorism, pornography, racism and self-harm. Out is any direct threat like &ldquo;Someone shoot Trump&rdquo; - but it allows details of how to murder women. ..Including: &ldquo;To snap a bitch&rsquo;s neck, apply your pressure to the middle of her throat&rdquo; does not break its rules. Abuse such as &ldquo;F*** off and die&rdquo; is allowed as well because neither it nor the bitch remark are &ldquo;credible threats&rdquo;. It also offers advice that some photos of kids suffering non-sexual physical abuse or bullying are OK unless there is an element of &ldquo;sadism or celebration&rdquo;. Facebook&rsquo;s rule book says it &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t want to censor or punish people in distress&rdquo;.

Wuttisan Wongtalay, 20, accused Jiranuch Trirat, 21, of cheating on him before disappearing with their child Beta. He climbed to the top of the building with the child before beginning a Facebook live stream. Harrowing footage shows Mr Wongtalay climb down the side of the building to retrieve the dying infant&#39;s body before killing himself. Shockingly, the girl&#39;s mum saw the video on Facebook and made a frantic call to police. But Facebook also permits videos of violent deaths &mdash; which it claims can highlight mental issues &mdash; and abortions....as long as there is no nudity. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has made repeated promises that the company wants to improve its processes as regards live streaming, particularly in the wake of the case of Steve Stephens, a Cleveland man who murdered a pensioner live in Facebook. Earlier this months the tech giant revealed plans to hire 3,000 people over the next year to monitor reports of inappropriate material, after a string of violent attacks were broadcast live on the social network.

We&#39;re working to make these videos easier to report.&quot;
