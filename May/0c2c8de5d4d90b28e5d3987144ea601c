A canvas portrait with images of National Super Alliance (NASA) principals was set on fire in protest during a Jubilee rally held in Nairobi on Monday. Supporters of the two leading political sides clashed outside Kenyatta International Conference Centre (KICC) as President Uhuru Kenyatta presented his papers to the electoral body for clearance. What was expected to be a calm event saw Jubilee supporters and those of National Super Alliance (NASA) exchanging words and later throwing stones at each other. This happened few minutes after 3:30 pm immediately President Uhuru, his Deputy William Ruto and their entourage of city Members of Parliament made their way to KICC grounds. Jubilee supporters had traversed the city through Jogoo Road-where President Uhuru had an address at Donholm to counter NASA&rsquo;s Sunday rally at the same area, although they were confronted by NASA supporters. Supporters of the two sides threw stones at each other holding the city at ransom for some time with motorists getting stranded.
