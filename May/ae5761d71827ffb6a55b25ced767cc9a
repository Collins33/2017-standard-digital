A section of vandalized SGR at Mariakani along the main Mombasa-Voi line. Another section in Kwale was also vandalized. [Maarufu Mohamed, Standard] Four suspects are being held in connection with vandalism of the Standard Gauge Railways at Kibanda-Hasara in Kwale County, about 30km west of Mombasa. The suspects include scrap metal dealers who were arrested in Voi Town in possession of materials including metal rails. Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko said the suspects and any others who will be caught will be charged as organised criminals and economic saboteurs. &ldquo;All those identified and apprehended will face the full force of the law and will be charged and prosecuted not as petty thieves but as organized criminals and economic saboteurs,&rdquo; he said in a statement. He added police are looking for more suspects. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet said they had expanded operations on vandals and would target those damaging power pylons and road furniture. &ldquo;Anyone found over this issue will be heavily punished,&rdquo; he warned. Vandalism of the rails happened on Friday night less than a week to the launch of the SGR. The vandals also destroyed communication cables. A 30-metre long fence was also destroyed. The affected section is part of phase one of SGR from Mombasa to Nairobi that cost a massive Sh327 billion. There are indications the saboteurs used specialised cutting tools before taking away the heavy steel components. President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the cargo train Tuesday and will be taking maiden trip on the passenger train on Tuesday. The railway is the country&rsquo;s biggest infrastructure project since independence. Government Spokesman Eric Kiraithe has urged leaders not to politicise the project and warned vandalism along the line and grandstanding statements on the basis of the railway line will not be tolerated.
