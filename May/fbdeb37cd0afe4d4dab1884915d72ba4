Tables may have turned on Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko&#39;s bid for the city&#39;s top job after his former Jubilee Party counterpart declared that he will be vying for the governor&#39;s seat as an independent candidate. On Friday, Peter Kenneth declared that he has joined the race for city hall after deep deliberation arguing that he had no choice after his complaints over the just concluded party primaries were not listened to. He said his decision to quit JP was informed on the primaries that he described as sham marred with vote stuffing which saw 93 appeals out of the 105 seats contested in Nairobi. &quot;...which is an indication of how badly the elections were organized or how well they were rigged,&quot; said Kenneth. However, he said this does not stop him to offer his support for the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Dismissing claims that his bid is just out to spoil for Sonko who has since received a &#39;blessing&#39; from JP led by Deputy President William Ruto, Kenneth said he has the ability to stand by himself.

My campaigns will be in all the 85 wards and I will walk with the people,&quot; said Kenneth. Sonko did win the primaries with over 138,000 votes. Addressing the media on Friday, a rather re-energized Kenneth portrayed his candidature as that of the savior of the city dismissing both Sonko and incumbent Evans Kidero saying they have nothing to show for the four years they have been in power. Indirectly referring to the recent unveiling of former Vivo Energy Polycarp Igathe as the running mate to Sonko to sanitize the senator&#39;s managerial image, Kenneth said no governor can succeed by relegating their managerial duties to their deputies and concentrate on politics. &quot;Nairobi needs a governor who will not only manage but implement. He should have information about the county, meet with investors and not the kind who will be prepped on city issues,&quot; said Kenneth. The former Gatundu South Member of Parliament criticized Kidero&#39;s government saying the incumbent has nothing to show for the over Sh100 billion allocated to the county. &quot;Kidero is a manager who has failed-the senator too-and his track record can attest to that. Personally, I have never been involved in any scandal,&quot; he said. ALSO READ: Jubilee on the spot after awarding certificate to aspirant with &lsquo;forged&rsquo; papers
