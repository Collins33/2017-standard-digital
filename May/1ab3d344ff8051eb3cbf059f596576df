Two Cabinet secretaries have urged western Kenya residents to re-elect President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto. Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa and his Gender counterpart, Cecily Kairuki, said Jubilee had achieved most of its pre-election promises and deserved another term. The county is perceived to be an Opposition stronghold, but the two said the competition to win votes in the August elections should be based on ideals and manifestoes. &quot;The President has done his part and is asking for another chance. He has delivered on many of his promises, especially on matters touching on women like free maternity,&quot; Mr Wamalwa said. The two spoke when they attended the women&#39;s conference at the Pentecostal Assemblies of God headquarters at Nyang&#39;ori and were accompanied by County Commissioner Pauline Dola. Wamalwa said the country was maturing politically and, therefore, the time had come for politicians to sell their policies without using inciting and abusive language.

Let us now campaign using our manifestoes and not abusing each other,&quot; Wamalwa said
