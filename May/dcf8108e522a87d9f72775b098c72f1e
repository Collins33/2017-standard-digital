Teachers will Friday know the finer details of their Sh54 billion salary deal as unions meet the employer. At the end of the meeting, it will be clear how much each of the 300,000 teachers will pocket from July 1 once parties agree how much of the pay deal would be paid out and in how many phases. The meeting involving Teachers Service Commission (TSC), Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) and Kenya Union of Post Secondary School Teachers (Kuppet), will end the growing anxiety on the implementation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). President Uhuru Kenyatta promised teachers they would get the pay rise starting July 1. And to end the long wait,&nbsp;TSC&nbsp;has called a stakeholders meeting today to discuss how the new payment will be rolled out. &quot;TSC&nbsp;has organised a one-day stakeholders meeting on May 5, 2017. The purpose of the forum is to share implementation report of the CBA 2017-2021,&quot; said Chief Executive Officer Nancy Macharia. The two teachers unions were, however, negotiating with the&nbsp;TSC&nbsp;to allow them go through the implementation matrix before other players are roped in. Officials from both unions said it would be appropriate to let the negotiating team first understand the details before other members are brought in. TSC&nbsp;has also invited officials of primary and secondary teachers&#39; associations to the meeting. The meeting, however, means teachers will today know whether the CBA will be implemented fully at once or staggered.
