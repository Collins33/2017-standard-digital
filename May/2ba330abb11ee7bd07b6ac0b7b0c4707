Kenya is set to hold talks this week with the United States in a bid to have Washington resume aid to Kenya&#39;s health sector that was suspended last week over corruption concerns, Kenyan officials said Monday. Kenya&#39;s Health Cabinet Secretary Cleophas Mailu told a media briefing that the talks will help Kenya finalize its position on the concrete steps to give comfort to donors to the health sector. &quot;We are confident that in the next weeks, the U.S. will rescind its decision suspending aid to Kenya&#39;s health sector,&quot; Mailu said when the Health Ministry donated medical commodities to faith -based institutions worth 2.65 million U.S. dollars. The U.S. Agency for International Development last week issued a directive to withhold logistics support to Kenya&#39;s health sector until certain issues are resolved. The CS said that the suspension will not affect service delivery of drugs or family planning services at Kenya&#39;s health institutions. &quot;So Kenyan should not have any fear that there will be stock outs at public health facilities,&quot; he added. Mailu said that Kenya has been strengthening its procurement systems since last year when an audit revealed that funds were misappropriated. &quot;The aim is to ensure that the system is tamper proof so that both government and donor money is not lost,&quot; he added. &quot;However the reforms will not be complete overnight but we are committed to complete by next week, so that donors are assured that their money is safe,&quot; he noted.
