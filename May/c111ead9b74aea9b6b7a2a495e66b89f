Garissa Women Representative Shukran Hussein Gure has suffered a blow after hacking of her Facebook account. Shukran says the unknown persons have taken over the account and been posting false reports. One of the posts claims the MP has surrendered from the race after allegedly obtaining a US citizenship. &quot;I am devastated by the development and I am urging my supporters to ignore the posts. I am firmly in the race to defend my seat,&quot; the Wiper legislator said. She added that she is working with IT experts and authorities to identify the people behind it whom she suspects have been sponsored by her rivals. &quot;I suspect my rivals are afraid of me and have resorted to such uncouth acts,&quot; Shukran said adding that it&#39;s unfortunate that some blogs had picked the posts to run stories of her quitting.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Leaders urged to desist from inciting statements during campaigns
