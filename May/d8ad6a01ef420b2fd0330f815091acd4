As lovely as it no doubt is to get married, no one could be blamed for pausing to think, &lsquo;is planning a wedding really worth it?&rsquo; Yes, being married supposedly makes you better off and, in a slap to the face for single people, reportedly means you to live longer. Then again, there&#39;s the cost , the stress, the weird family politics and the pressure you put yourself under to get everything just-so. There&#39;s another downside to going down the wedding path, and not many newlyweds talk about it. Post-wedding shame Different to &#39;hangover shame&#39;, where you basically feel bad because you acted like a tool the night before, post-wedding shame is not &quot;shame that&#39;s over, what an ace day&quot;. ALSO READ: Avoid using these words if you want to get lucky in love It&#39;s a deep-seated shame that the whole day, the entire &pound;20k enterprise was FAILURE and it is much, much trickier to shrug off than a standard hangover cringey flashback. One woman who recently got married told Ravishly exactly how bad this shame can be. Judge for yourself whether you think it&#39;s warranted or not. &quot;My partner and I recently got married after ten years together. We decided on a smaller wedding for budget reasons (and sanity),&quot; she began. She admitted they &quot;did have a wonderful day with close friends and family, despite some rain and other mishaps. I was never one to obsess over weddings, and our planning was not extensive. It&#39;s been weighing on the woman&#39;s mind, even months after her wedding &quot;I felt great the day of the wedding, but the &#39;hangover&#39; (not just alcohol related) was pretty awful. This wedding happened months ago, but I still feel absolute shame over the event.&rdquo; ALSO READ: Our sisters from Central should wake up to reality of polygamy &quot;A handful of people could not come at the last minute due to family emergencies, weather, etc., and a lot of folks left early in the night which left an embarrassingly small dance crowd. I was also so absolutely horrified to be the centre of such attention, so I hardly remember our ceremony as my mind was a blur (which makes me really regretful). &quot; It wasn&#39;t just a &#39;numbers&#39; issue either. Looking over the pictures has caused the newlywed a lot of distress. &quot;I slouched in all the photos. Nobody sat in the front rows at all, so the photos show a bunch of empty plastic chairs, which looks awkward. &quot;There were no sunsets, a good friend was missing, two people no-showed entirely, and my bra strap is showing in one photo. These were just some of the things that felt very &#39;less than.&#39;&quot; The woman continues, &quot;I know people experience some type of letdown after weddings. &quot;Mine was all related to thinking it was just inadequate, despite having a wonderful time in the thick of the day. How weird. &quot;Now, all of these complaints sound minor, and honestly petty (to myself included). Even worrying about this stuff makes me feel slightly weird or guilty, especially months later! ALSO READ: Jealous girlfriend kills love rival in horror car chase &quot;I think (one of) the real issues here is that my partner and I were the centre of an event (about us!) and it just wasn&#39;t &#39;good enough.&#39; &quot;Telling myself this is &#39;stupid&#39; or insignificant and to just &#39;get over it&#39; (my self-talk) is not helpful at all. I also realise this may go deeper than &#39;just the wedding,&#39; however this is my current &quot;shame event&quot; if you will.&quot; Aside from striking cold, cold fear into the hearts of anyone who&#39;s getting married soon, this is a worrying and revealing insight into a side of getting married no one really talks about. The woman on Ravishly was given advice by columnist Erin Khar , who seemed to think there were other things at play. &quot;You mentioned at the end of your email that this is your &#39;current shame event.&#39; &quot;Patterns like this can be hardwired, like playing an old tape of lies, over and over. As bad as the shame feels, it may be familiar. &quot;If this resonates, I encourage you to seek the guidance of a therapist, because I imagine it is affecting other parts of your life, too. &quot;Don&#39;t be so hard on yourself for what you&#39;re feeling. Rather, take the time and space to get clear on what it is that&#39;s actually upsetting you.&quot; ALSO READ: Jealous girlfriend kills love rival in horror car chase There is, without a doubt, a huge amount of pressure in couples to deliver the Insta-worthy goods. But if getting married elicits this sort of reaction - even months later - it might be time to re-examine what it is we&#39;re putting ourselves through.&nbsp;
