The Meru council of elders has cursed Lands Cabinet Secretary Prof Jacob&nbsp;Kaimenyi&nbsp;and asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to sack him. Hundreds of elders congregated at the Njuri Ncheke shrine in Nchiru, Tigania West on Saturday and conducted the ritual. They cursed Prof&nbsp;Kaimenyi&nbsp;and Chuka University vice chancellor Prof Elias Njoka for allegedly disuniting the elders, leading to the council splitting into two factions. The elders, who addressed the media after the ritual, accused&nbsp;Kaimenyi&nbsp;and Njoka of using their positions in government to disunite the council formed about 100 years ago. Led by Chairman, Linus Kathera, and secretary general, Josphat Murangiri, the elders said the two can only be cleansed after paying &quot;Mirongo ithatu&quot; a heavy fine according to the community customs. The ceremony coincided with the convention of&nbsp;Kaimenyi, who met professionals from Imenti North constituency at the Meru national polytechnic.

The elders said they will march to State House should the president fail to sack&nbsp;Kaimenyi. They issued an ultimatum lapsing June 14. &quot;We want to tell the government that CS&nbsp;Kaimenyi&nbsp;is the one who lead a group of elders who meet in hotels, which created confusion in the Meru community as they think we have two factions of Njuri Ncheke . Salesio M&#39;ngechu, the council&#39;s Igembe central chair added that&nbsp;Kaimenyi&nbsp;and Njoka, have colluded with the ousted council leaders Phares Rutere and Paul M&#39;ithinkia and have tainted the name of the council, which warranted their excommunication. &quot;As the elders we want&nbsp;Kaimenyi&nbsp;to be sacked as the minister because he is using his position to fight Njuri Ncheke,&quot; M&#39;ngechu added. The elders who seem to be angered by the CS support to the ousted council leaders said they are the ones who pleaded with the president to appoint&nbsp;Kaimenyi&nbsp;who is also a Member of Njuri Ncheke. They said the president should sack&nbsp;Kaimenyi&nbsp;because he has defied and disrespected the elders who are a symbol of unity among the Ameru community.

When he is in Meru he holds meetings with a group of elders comprising of the ousted elders who were cursed by the council. They meet to strategize on how to fight us,&quot; another elder Joseph Muriungi said. Prof&nbsp;Kaimenyi&nbsp;held a press conference where he termed the curse as boorish. &quot;It is surprising for the elders to go to the shrine and say&nbsp;Kaimenyi&nbsp;and Njoka are the ones causing the infighting in the Njuri Ncheke while they do not have evidence to support their claims. &quot;What l know is that Njuri Ncheke loves every child of a &#39;Meruan&#39;, now that you have started to curse your children&nbsp;Kaimenyi&nbsp;and Njoka what kind of elders are you?,&quot; Prof&nbsp;Kaimenyi&nbsp;posed. He said that the leadership of the elders who cursed him at the shrine were not even recognised by the registrar of societies. &quot;Ask them if their names are in the register at the registrar of societies,&quot; he said. The CS also noted that he was not appointed in his position because of the elders endorsement, and dared them to influence his sacking.

Who are they to call for my sacking?&quot;Kaimenyi&nbsp;posed. He said the elders were not genuine by supporting re-election of President Uhuru as they have been claiming if they could fight a CS he (Uhuru) appointed.
