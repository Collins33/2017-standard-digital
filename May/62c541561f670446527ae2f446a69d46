Nairobi City resident Joe Ndile is very concerned about something that he vows smells and looks like corruption. And it touches on City Hall, the hallowed colonial building where Nairobi County boss Evans Kidero transacts his business. Mr Ndile claims some of Kidero&#39;s charges have illegally allocated a loading zone meant for businesses along Mfangano Street; between Choppers Supermarket (formerly Ukwala) and Eastmatt. &quot;Which city county by-laws allow public service vehicles to be allocated a loading zone? When did passengers become mizigo (luggage)?&quot; he asks. According Ndile, business owners are forced to look for parking spaces elsewhere due to this &quot;corruption&quot;. Things get more complicated whenever they need to load or unload goods to or from their vehicles. &quot;It becomes a cat-and-mouse game since they are forced to double park and be careful not to be caught by city council traffic marshalls and also the traffic police,&quot; he says and asks: &quot;When will this corruption end, Mr Kidero?&quot; His contact is [email&#160;protected] Also unhappy with county government is Tony Banks. Mr Banks is convinced that both the government and the Member of County Assembly for Claycity Ward are in deep slumber due to the sorry state of Mwiki-Kasarani road, which he says is full of potholes.
