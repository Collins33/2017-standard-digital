Scores of herders from Isiolo and Marsabit are feared dead as they engaged each other in deadly gun battle throughout Friday. The fight was sparked off by an attack by herders from Laisamis, in Marsabit when those from Merti went to Barchuma along the border of the two counties to pursue their animals that were stolen three days earlier. Residents from the two sides said the herders exchanged fire that led to deaths estimated to be over 10 people, both sides had casualties but the Isiolo side reportedly lost more men. The battle reportedly started at 5 am and lasted until 2 pm where more than 1,000 animals were stolen. The area is remote and lacks communication. It is located nearly 150 km from Merti and close to 200 from Isiolo town. Last evening Isiolo County Police Commander Charles Ontita said they have report of three deaths and four injured from Merti. However, relatives of those involved in the clashes who spoke to The Standard on Saturday said seven people from Merti have been killed and four injured on their side. &#39;&#39;People from Merti have so far managed to bring seven bodies whose preparation for burial is now underway. The four injured are undergoing treatment at Merti Health Centre,&#39;&#39; said local who lost his younger brother. The man said their side had also managed to recover some of the stolen animals. Reports indicate the Laisamis side also lost some fighters. Mr Ontita said the Merti side had gone to the border area to pursue their animals that were stolen at Koya on Wednesday when they had gone there in search of water. &quot;The Laisamis herders reported that they found the missing animals on their side and when the herders from Merti went to get back their animals, they were attacked,&quot; said the officer. He said security personnel have been sent to the area to intervene between the sides and patrol the affected areas. [email&#160;protected]
