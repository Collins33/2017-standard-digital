Kisumu Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga has accused the State of side-lining the Odingas because of her brother&#39;s political ambition. Ruth said her family members were being sidelined in political leadership because of their relationship to National Super Alliance (NASA) presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga. Ruth alleged members of the larger Odinga family were finding it difficult&nbsp; to get elective and public service jobs. Opening up on the impact of the country&#39;s politics on her family, Ruth appealed to Kenyans not to treat the rest of the Odinga family unfairly and or with political contempt. &quot;Even when we run for elective seats, it is the people who hold the sovereign power to decide who to pick and so it may not necessarily be an automatic win as some always perceive it to be,&quot; she said. She gave an example of Nominated MP Oburu Odinga whose attempt to run for the Bondo parliamentary seat and application to become a member of the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) were met with protests.

She claimed that a section of ODM supporters were also sidelining the Odingas over their brother, Raila.
