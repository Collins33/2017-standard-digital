An estimated 150,000 police officers who will oversee elections will receive training in election laws to effectively deal with lawbreakers. This is an increase from the 95,000 officers who manned the 2013 elections. The officers are part of 180,000 personnel expected to ensure that the elections are fair and credible. Meanwhile, 92 special magistrates have been appointed to hear election disputes while a squad of 105 officers has been established to deal with hate speech and other electoral offences as campaigns kick off on May 28. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet said the role of the special officers was to enforce the law before, during and after the elections. &quot;We will not be political, we will be impartial and we will apply the law as it is. We will take no nonsense from anybody irrespective of political affiliations,&quot; said Mr Boinnet during the launch of an election security manual.
