Just what caused the widespread arson attacks on schools that engulfed the country last year? A Task Force formed to unearth the causes has incredibly listed 50 reasons. Out of that, organised criminal gangs that infiltrated the schools, lack of coordination between the Teachers Service Commission and the Education ministry on addressing teachers&#39; welfare, posts on social media where students incite each other and political interference like when politicians dictate who gets chosen as school heads stand out. A study conducted in 98 schools from 38 counties and executed based on the magnitude of destruction outlines &#39;too many examinations that have put an intolerable burden on students&quot; as having fanned the unrest. The team led by renowned educationist Grace Mulei has since given 29 proposals and recommendations aimed at fostering discipline in schools and thereby avert such cases in future. It is highly inconceivable that these grievances are not tied to financial impropriety in the schools that then triggers a chain reaction. So the proposal that bursars and principals be subjected to lifestyle audits to avoid misappropriation of funds is welcome, just like the recommendation that principals in schools with large populations have two or even three deputies to ensure they are not overwhelmed. All in all, the findings look good on paper. It is up to the ministry to ensure they are implemented promptly. ALSO READ: State releases Sh9 billion as schools open for new term
