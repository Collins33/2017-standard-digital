It is the end of the road for bogus colleges that cheat innocent students by awarding them fake or unacceptable certificates and diploma papers. Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i said the certification mess had created anarchy in the education sector, with students holding conflicting papers. The CS said employers have been exposed to a mixed bag of diploma papers, some obtained after only three months of study. &quot;There are diploma papers obtained after six months, two years, and some after three years. We must standardise all these and have clear pathways,&quot; said Dr Matiang&#39;i. He added that some private institutions set up colleges and admit students, yet no one knows what they teach. Speaking during a stakeholders&#39; meeting to discuss the draft Kenya Qualifications Framework in Nairobi, Matiang&#39;i said the era of fake certificates would soon be over forever.

We are stepping back to talk about order,&quot; said Matiang&#39;i. The proposed Kenya Qualifications Framework seeks to provide one-stop accreditation, teaching/training, testing, assessment, and evaluation services for qualifications and accreditations.&nbsp; &nbsp;
