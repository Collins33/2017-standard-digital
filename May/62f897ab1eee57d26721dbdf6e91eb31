Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati cited lack of resources as the main contributing factor to the slow start of the Orange Democratic Movement&rsquo;s primaries in his constituency. Ballot papers in some of stations arrived late. &ldquo;Parties don&rsquo;t have enough money to put in place security, agents and every person in place there has been problems but those problems have been overcome,&rdquo; he said. Some tallying stations were also combined due to inadequate resources from the party, he said. He, however, remained optimistic that he would bag the ODM parliamentary ticket telling Jubilee to expect a thrashing on August 8 in the constituency. Confident Speaking to reporters after he cast his vote at Kilimani Primary School, a confident Arati said the day marked the start of another five-year term for him. &ldquo;Of course today is the start of another term of five years, Jubilee can&rsquo;t beat us. That one we are sure, even if they put their machinery down here we will beat them at their own game.&rdquo; ALSO READ: Joyce Laboso proposes return of County Development Boards' bill The winner of the ticket is expected to face Nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi who won the Dagoretti North Jubilee Party ticket.
