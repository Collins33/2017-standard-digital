Opposition leaders have blamed the Jubilee government for the incessant insecurity in&nbsp;Baringo. NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga, who addressed residents at Marigat yesterday, accused President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, of doing nothing to improve the region&#39;s security. Raila said the security situation had continued to deteriorate even after the Deputy President visited &quot;30 times&quot;, and urged locals to vote them out during the August elections. The ODM leader, who termed Uhuru and Ruto as failures, said: &quot;What is being experienced here is what other people elsewhere only see in the movies.&quot; &quot;In one of (the DP&#39;s) visits to&nbsp;Baringo, bandits attacked and disrupted one of the meetings he had convened. He disappeared and later gave people guns to take care of themselves,&quot; claimed Raila. He added: &quot;The security situation here has reached alarming levels. This government has totally failed and must now be sent home.&quot; ALSO READ: NASA: We will accept nothing but results at the polling stations &quot;Even after the President ordered the deployment of the Kenya Defence Forces, the situation has not improved. Instead of flashing out bandits,&quot; he claimed. Raila said he was saddened to see people living like refugees in their homeland. He urged locals to come out in large numbers and vote for NASA candidates, &quot;so you can assist us send the Jubilee government home&quot;. &quot;The Jubilee government has proved it cannot take care of its people. They have neglected you. We will ensure interests of the people of&nbsp;Baringo&nbsp;are taken care of when we take over power,&quot; said Raila. His running mate Kalonzo Musyoka said NASA would bring down the cost of living by growing the economy and improving infrastructure. &quot;Vote in a government that will take care of your needs, not a government of a few people. There is no need of paying taxes if the government does not take care of your needs,&quot; said Kalonzo. NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi said: &quot;Jubilee has borrowed so much money and misused it. They are now putting pressure on Kenyans with so many empty promises. When we take over, we will use taxes to improve the lives of all Kenyans.&quot; They said the sharp increase in cost of basic commodities was as a result of heavy borrowing. &quot;They (Jubilee) are using taxes to pay debts instead of offering services to the people,&quot; said Mudavadi.
