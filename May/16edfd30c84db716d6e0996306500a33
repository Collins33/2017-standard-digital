Eleven teachers won the nominations under different parties in Baringo County in the just-concluded primaries. And those that Sunday Standard spoke to have big dreams for the county. The man who will fly the Jubilee Party ticket for the Baringo Governor&rsquo;s seat Stanley Kiptis, a teacher by profession, wants to bring change by being actively involved in politics. &ldquo;Traditional practices such as raiding neighbours for cattle have been a catalyst that fuels insecurity. As teachers we will spearhead change through&nbsp;education&nbsp;to curb such vices,&rdquo; said Mr Kiptis. Another candidate, also a teacher, Samwel Kipchumba the KANU flag bearer for the Sacho ward ticket, said they stand a strong chance to win the August 8 polls given their critical role in the society. &ldquo;As teachers we have an easy way to connect with the electorates. When the locals want to hold consultations on matters of public interest we are usually the first people they run to. They trust us,&rdquo; said Kipchumba. Other teachers who have won the nominations under various political parties are Richard Lokong (Soi Ward), Aengwo Birit (Kipsaraman Ward), Joel Kipchew (Kabartonjo Ward), Erick Koima (Kisanana Ward). Others are Raphael Chebolei (Ewalel Ward), Cornelius Kirui (Mumberes Ward) and Susan Chesiyna who is eyeing the county&rsquo;s woman rep seat.

Meanwhile, a number of the nominees have noted that majority of the current MCAs were not able to perform well in their duties because they lacked post-secondary&nbsp;education.
