The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) top manager has been sent home over claims of sabotage. Director for&nbsp;ICT James Muhati was Friday evening sent on a compulsory leave by the commission following accusations that he had refused to cooperate in an ongoing audit of ICT systems. The decision to out him was reached at the plenary meeting chaired by chairman Wafula Chebukati and attended by all commissioners and CEO Ezra Chiloba. Chebukati personally signed the memo sending Muhati home for a month and appointed manager Chris Msando as the acting director. The commission was irked by failure by Muhati to respond to a memo by his colleague director of Audit, Risk and Compliance Obadiah Keitany dated 17th May. In the internal memo, Keitany accused Muhati of refusing to cooperate on authentication of the commission&#39;s software and hardware licences and certificates.
