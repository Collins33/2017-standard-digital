Uhuru Kenyatta is the current president of the Republic of Kenya, elected in the 2013 general election under a The National Alliance (TNA) ticket. The 54 year old holds a university degree in Economics, and Political Science from Amherst College in the United States (US).&nbsp; Kenyatta&rsquo;s transition into active politics commenced in 2001 when he was nominated as an MP into retired president Moi&rsquo;s regime. His nomination led him to serve as a Minister (Cabinet Secretary) for Local government, before venturing into his presidential aspirations in the 2002 General Election. In 2002, President Kenyatta first ventured into presidential politics, vying under a Kenya African National Union (KANU) ticket, but lost to retired president Mwai Kibaki&rsquo;s party alliance, National Rainbow Coalition (NARC). His loss, however, brought him into being KANU&rsquo;s chairman, a party that wove him back to the presidential race in 2007. Kenyatta led his Kenya African National Union (KANU) party into a stiff presidential race against Mwai Kibaki, Raila Odinga, Martha Karua and Kalonzo Musyoka, but however joined Mwai Kibaki&rsquo;s Party of National Unity (PNU), rallying his supporters behind Kibaki. Kibaki&rsquo;s win in the election saw the further appointment of Kenyatta as Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister in the 2008 Coalition government. In 2009, Kenyatta was transferred to being a Minister for Finance, before finally resigning in 2012 to run for presidency, clinching the closely contested seat under a TNA (The National Alliance) ticket.&nbsp; President Kenyatta currently serves as the spear header of the Jubilee Party. He is also the presidential candidate preceding the general election in 8th August 2017, alongside his running mate and Deputy President; William Ruto.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Blow to gender equity in party polls &nbsp;
