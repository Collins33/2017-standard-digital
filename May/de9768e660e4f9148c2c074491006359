ODM officials&#39; campaign for party candidates to be elected for all seats continued to face resistance in Nyanza. The party&#39;s top officials led by deputy leader Hassan Joho, Homa Bay County chairman Gladys Wanga, Nominated MP Oburu Oginga and Senator Moses Kajwang&#39; were shocked when crowds rejected their calls for a six-piece voting pattern in Siaya, Migori and Homa Bay. The leaders had a difficult time campaigning for the ODM candidates with crowds saying they were only giving an assurance on NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga. They cheered when the leaders campaigned for Raila but murmured and jeered when asked to support all ODM candidates. The leaders asked voters to ignore those contesting various seats as independent candidates and vote for ODM from the wards to the presidency. They said Raila needed the numbers to be a stable President. ALSO READ: Ignore independents and vote for ODM candidates, locals urged &quot;Raila needs the numbers. We cannot elect him the President without a majority in Parliament, the Senate and county assemblies,&quot; said Ms Wanga. Wanga, who is leading the presidential campaign team in Nyanza, said Raila needed total support from Nyanza and asked those for change to rally behind him. &quot;Let us forget the differences caused by the party nominations and unite as a family behind our son, because he has the best chance this time round,&quot; said Wanga. Oburu said bitterness from the ODM primaries should not be allowed to&nbsp; interfere with the NASA presidential campaigns. He said even he had forgotten the bitter rivalry between him and Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda during the nominations. &quot;We were bitter rivals with Mr Ochanda but we are now working together for the sake of our destiny,&quot; said Dr Oburu. The crowds listened attentively as they campaigned for Raila and Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda but broke into murmurs when Wanga asked them to support Mr Rasanga.&nbsp;&quot;Mano to wee!&nbsp;(Leave that one)&quot; they shouted.

In Homa Bay, Senator Kajwang&#39; had a difficult time campaigning for a six-piece-suit pattern in the county. Mr Kajwang&#39; had gone to the market to talk to traders who lost their property in a fire incident in the town last weekend. However, he met resistance from the residents when he began wooing them to vote all ODM candidates from MCA to President. [email&#160;protected]
