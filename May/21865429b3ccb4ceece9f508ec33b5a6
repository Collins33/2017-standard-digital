ODM party delegates meet at Kasarani Stadium in Nairobi to endorse Raila Odinga as the party&rsquo;s presidential nominee in the August election. Raila has been selected as the joint presidential candidate of the Opposition National Super Alliance (NASA). However, since NASA is a coalition and not a registered political party, Raila&rsquo;s name will appear on the ballot alongside an Orange symbol. It will be Raila&rsquo;s fourth endorsement to run for presidency and perhaps the last in his political career where he has been for decades. This comes after losers in the Orange party primaries threatened to decamp from the party and vie as independent candidates or join other parties decrying anomalies during the nomination exercise.
