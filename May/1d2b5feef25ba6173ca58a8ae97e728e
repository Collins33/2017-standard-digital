Practising advocates in Kirinyaga County will now be required to deposit copies of their certified certificates at the area High Court to curb impostors. The area Court Users Committee has further directed that such advocates provide their specimen signatures with the Deputy Registrar and the Land Registrar. This comes in the wake of rampant land fraud incidents in the area perpetuated by brokers said to work in corroboration with unscrupulous lawyers. The committee&#39;s chairman, Justice Boaz Olao said land fraud incidents have become rampant, with families being conned of their inheritance. &quot;We must come up with stringent measures to curb the malpractice and save innocent members of the public who are falling prey to the vice,&quot; he said. Olao, who is also the presiding Judge at the Kerugoya High Court said the sensitivity of land issues must be addressed with the seriousness they deserve.&nbsp;
