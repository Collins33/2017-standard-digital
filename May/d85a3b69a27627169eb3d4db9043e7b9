Tanzania&rsquo;s anti-graft watchdog said it had frozen the assets of its chief accountant and planned to charge him with corruption, part of an aggressive anti-graft drive in which thousands of officials have already lost their jobs. The state-run Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) said it had secured a magistrate&rsquo;s order freezing the assets of Godfrey Gugai, its chief accountant. They include six vehicles and 40 apartments, houses and prime plots in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam and other major urban centres.
