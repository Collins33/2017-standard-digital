Plans are underway to recruit staff in the civil service in order to fill the ageing gap. Public Service Board chairman Margaret Kobia said Kenyans should not panic over the ageing work force in the civil service as the exercise has already commenced in a number of ministries. &quot;We plan to recruit at least two per cent of technical staff each year. What we have done is we have looked at each department in each ministry and identified positions that need to be filled,&quot; Prof Kobia said. She added: &quot;The focus is to identify and fill jobs that require skills in ministries where staff have retired or left especially at the directorate level.&quot; She said recruitment will be carried out through transfers within ministries especially where they are more skilled staff to departments with less. &quot;There are ministries with staff not positioned by PSC. We will promote those who can perform the job as well as identify vacancies that do not have skilled staff,&quot; she said.
