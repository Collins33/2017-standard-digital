The 120 faithful of Nomiya Church who were accused of endorsing President Uhuru Kenyatta have remained defiant, saying they have the right to visit State House. Officials of the Central Council of Nomiya Faith Churches, which is the umbrella fellowship of seven registered splinter groups, fought off allegations that they were imposters pursuing personal interests. In a rejoinder to several claims by top clergy from the splinters, the officials sought to clarify that the theme of the controversial tour on May 2 was hinged on calls for peace during the electioneering period. Their other agenda, according to a statement, was to lobby Uhuru to initiate an intervention that would lower the cost of basic commodities.
