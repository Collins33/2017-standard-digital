The supply of critical medicines for HIV, Malaria and Family planning supported by USAID through the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority has not been affected by US funding cut for the Health Ministry. Sh65 billion (USD 650 million) 5 year contract between USAID and KEMSA signed in November 2015 has seen&nbsp; KEMSA procure, warehouse and distribute medicines for HIV, Malaria and others to public health facilities as an agent of the US Government. These includes pharmaceuticals, supplies, food commodities, laboratory reagents and equipment. When the Standard contacted the KEMSA Ag CEO Mr Philip Odhiambo he declined to comment stating that so far no issue has been raised but should we require further information we should contact USAID or the Ministry of Health. The US move to maintain support appears to indicate donor confidence for the crucial agency.&nbsp; The support to KEMSA which is currently in the second year also includes supply of HIV/Aids test kits and medications, contraceptives, malaria test kits and drugs as well as maternal and child-health equipment for all public hospitals across the 47 counties. The five-year Sh65 billion deal that continues till 2020 was the largest award by a USAID bilateral mission ever. It is also the largest donor-supported programme for the public drugs agency which supplies drugs to health facilities under the national and county governments. In the recent years, KEMSA has been relying partly on offering procurement, warehousing and distribution services for donor-supported programmes to generate income apart from selling medicines to counties The US funding cut would have been a big blow on the sustainability of the drugs agency.
