ODM leader Raila Odinga told off Jubilee government on the high cost of living. He said Kenyans are suffering as a result of increased food and fuel prices. He added that it was ironical that the government would opt to buy maize from Mexican farmers at a higher price while Kenyan farmers were being frustrated. Raila Odinga also insisted that NASA will have a parallel tallying centre during August 2017 polls saying results can only be announced at constituency level. He was speaking at a NASA rally in Kisii County on Wednesday. He urged youths to turn out in numbers and vote for NASA. Mr Odinga said that during his Jerusalem visit, he went to pray for the country. &ldquo;I will be Joshua, and Kalonzo will be Caleb,&rdquo; said Raila.
