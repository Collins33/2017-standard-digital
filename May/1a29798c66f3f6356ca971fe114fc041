Kanu Chairman Gideon Moi has asked Laikipia County voters to give Maina Njenga a chance to lead them, saying he will defend the rights of marginalised groups. Gideon said he was looking forward to working with Njenga in the Senate to tackle insecurity in the neighbouring counties of Laikipia and Baringo. &ldquo;Njenga has been a leader throughout his life, fighting for the rights of fellow Kenyans. Give him the chance to fight for your rights at the national level,&rdquo; the Baringo Senator said. &ldquo;We are facing the same challenges of bandit attacks in Baringo and Laikipia counties.
