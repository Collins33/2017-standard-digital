Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe insisted on Thursday that his country is not a failed state and accused the US of being fragile because of its economic dependence on China. Mugabe pointed to Zimbabwe&#39;s 90-percent literacy rate to support his claim that the southern African country, which has battled economic chaos in recent years, is one of the best resourced on the continent. &quot;We are not a poor country and we can&#39;t be a fragile country, I can call America fragile, they went on their knees to China,&quot; he said during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum on Africa in Durban. &quot;Zimbabwe is the most highly developed country in Africa after South Africa.&quot; Long-time leader Mugabe has ruled through the country&#39;s dramatic economic collapse. Hyperinflation wiped out savings more than 10 years ago, unemployment is sky-high and economic output has halved since 2000, when many white-owned farms were seized.

They clamp down on freedom of the media and the rights of people,&quot; she said. &quot;Let us give others a chance, it is important that we have elections that are free and fair -- that reflect the will of the people, that is at the heart of governance.&quot; Mugabe, 93, appeared to fall asleep at the end of the session.
