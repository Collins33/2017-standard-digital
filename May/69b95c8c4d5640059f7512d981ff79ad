Rivalry between two contestants for the Tigania East parliamentary seat played out at a local church where they taunted each other over development. The incumbent Mpuru Aburi and Josphat Gichunge, who is hoping to unseat the MP, accused each other of poor development. Gichunge also accused Aburi of misappropriating National Youth Service (NYS) funds meant to pay youths hired to work in the constituency. However, Mr Aburi said no&nbsp;NYS&nbsp;money was looted. He said some of those hired were paid through M-Pesa while the rest would be paid &quot;soon&quot;. Part of the money was saved in a Sacco. &quot;Your money is safe.&nbsp;NYS&nbsp;will start paying the balance soon,&quot; Aburi said.
