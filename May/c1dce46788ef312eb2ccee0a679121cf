BUNGOMA, KENYA: They say necessity is the mother of invention and two high school students have proved this to be true. Felix Kapulie, 18, and Patrick Agoya, 17, impressed participants at the Western Kenya Science and Engineering Fair with an automated bed-wetting sensor. The Form Four students from Sikusi Boys Secondary School in Bungoma County showcased a system that automatically detects when a sleeping child wets the bed, takes pictures and sends signal to caretakers via mobile phone. Using a battery, mobile phone, urine sensor, alarm and connecting cables, the pair linked up a circuit that is completed by urine whenever a child wets the bed. A signal is then transmitted to a mobile phone. &quot;Urine activates the system because it contains hydrogen ions, which conduct electricity and hence complete the circuit - a call is made to the caretaker who can eventually responds by checking on the baby,&quot; explained Kapulie. The circuit also involves a music system that is activated when completed by the hydrogen ions in the urine. This turns on a lullaby that is meant to soothe the baby before the caretaker arrives. According to the two young inventors, with this device, mothers can monitor their children&#39;s well-being from the comfort of their computers.
