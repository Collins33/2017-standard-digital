Desire to look younger is driving the Chinese population to import tonnes of&nbsp;donkey&nbsp;meat from Kenya, which is in turn threatening to reduce the&nbsp;donkey&nbsp;numbers, a report reveals. The report published in January this year shows that China&rsquo;s demand for&nbsp;donkey&nbsp;hides is hinged on the skin&rsquo;s medicinal properties. A gelatinous material- E&rsquo;jiao - is believed to have anti-ageing and libido-enhancing properties, fueling the demand for&nbsp;donkey&nbsp;hides. The report, by UK-based charity, The&nbsp;Donkey&nbsp;Sanctuary, points out that demand for&nbsp;donkey&nbsp;hide is outstripping supply. It shows that 1.8 million&nbsp;donkey&nbsp;hides are traded every year while global demand is estimated at between four to ten million skins. As a result,&nbsp;donkey&nbsp;slaughtering has gone frenzy. The&nbsp;Donkey&nbsp;Sanctuary report suggests that the animal is being wiped out mainly due to Chinese appetite for medicinal components in the animal&rsquo;s hide. There are two abattoirs for&nbsp;donkeys&nbsp;in Kenya: Goldox Ltd, in Mogotio, Baringo County, and another one in Naivasha, Nakuru County. Between 200 and 300&nbsp;donkeys&nbsp;are slaughtered every day at Goldox, George Ogola, an officer at the company said in a phone interview.

Mr Lu Donglin, a Chinese national, who owns it, told a local publication that about 600&nbsp;donkeys&nbsp;are received at the abattoir on a good day and about 400 when the supply is low. Ogola told Sunday Standard that both meat and skin are harvested at Goldox. He however didn&rsquo;t specify whether the products are exported to any specific country. Only a year has gone by and already those opposed to slaughtering of&nbsp;donkeys&nbsp;are seeing their worries come true. There are about 3 million&nbsp;donkeys&nbsp;left in China, from 11 million in the early 1990s. China has hence trained its eyes to the rest of the world to continue its e&rsquo;jiao-eating lifestyle. Black market With its large&nbsp;donkey&nbsp;population and close trade relations with China, Africa is a key target for&nbsp;donkey&nbsp;buyers and Kenya is well in the mix. Before Goldox opened shop in Baringo an adult&nbsp;donkeyfetched about Sh2,000. But immediately the company&rsquo;s operations began the price increased fourfold to Sh8,000. &ldquo;There is no policy governing the slaughter of these animals. As it is today we don&rsquo;t know how many&nbsp;donkeysare still alive in Kenya since the trade in&nbsp;donkeys&nbsp;started,&rdquo; says Dr Solomon Onyango, a veterinary officer and the head of programmes at The&nbsp;Donkey&nbsp;Sanctuary Kenya. ALSO READ: Uhuru returns home with Sh21.9 billion from China The Kenyan government legalised the sale of&nbsp;donkey&nbsp;meat in 1999. In 2014, businessman John Kariuki constructed a slaughterhouse in Naivasha after he discovered&nbsp;donkeymeat had a ready market in China. &ldquo;I have been to China where there is high demand and market for&nbsp;donkey&nbsp;meat and this slaughterhouse will take care of that,&rdquo; he told the press then. Indeed, China seems to be the centripetal force pulling in trade in&nbsp;donkey&nbsp;body parts and products. Goldox is operating a legal business. This notwithstanding,&nbsp;Donkey&nbsp;Sanctuary Kenya has expressed worry that a black market is also flourishing. &ldquo;Donkeys&nbsp;are fetching way higher than they did a few years back. The demand for&nbsp;donkeys&nbsp;has also fuelled cases of&nbsp;donkey&nbsp;theft, which are then sold to abattoirs,&rdquo; Dr Onyango says. Gean Gilchrist, the Director of animal welfare at Kenya Society for protecting and care of Animals says the trade in&nbsp;donkey&nbsp;meat and hide is working against poor rural communities.

When sold once then killed for just Sh8,000, these benefits are wiped out at once,&rdquo; Gilchrist says. Recently, John Kariuki, the owner and CEO of Star Brilliant&nbsp;Donkey&nbsp;abattoir, told Africa Uncensored that One hide goes for Sh14,200 while an actual animal, ironically, averages at Sh10,000.
