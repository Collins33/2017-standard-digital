Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau will not participate in the Jubilee Party repeat nominations for Murang&rsquo;a governor race. This is despite the Political Parties Dispute Resolution Tribunal ordering a repeat poll within 48 hours. The three-member tribunal had on Friday ruled that the exercise in which Governor Mwangi wa Iria was declared winner, was marred by irregularities. The ruling gave Jamleck a lifeline and a second chance to square it out with Wa Iria, however, he opted out of any political contest in the August 8 General Election. But the legislator maintained that he won the nominations with 120,000 votes while claiming the vote was twisted in favour of his opponent. &ldquo;As far as am concerned I won the nomination but there was massive rigging. I am pleased with the tribunal&rsquo;s decision but I have decided not to tire the people of Murang&rsquo;a in a repeat process,&rdquo; he said Saturday.

I will nevertheless support President Uhuru Kenyatta,&rdquo; he added. Wa Iria had already moved to the High Court to challenge the decision by the Kyalo Mbobu-led tribunal. JP Secretary General Raphael Tuju had also indicated they would appeal the tribunal&rsquo;s decision, saying they did not have funds and time to conduct a fresh nomination. The MP had challenged the outcome where he garnered 118,274 votes against Wa Iria&rsquo;s 205,976 during the April 26 primaries.
