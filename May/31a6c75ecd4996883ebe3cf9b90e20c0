Kenya is among the countries that will benefit from a &pound;400 million (Sh53.4 billion) current global investment kitty from United Kingdom&rsquo;s national carrier, British Airways. The airline&rsquo;s country manager Kevin Leung said part of the funds will be channelled towards improving the newly built First and Club World lounge at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and catering services. Mr Leung said this is part of the carrier&rsquo;s ongoing strategic investment being made by the airline in its traditional markets.&nbsp;
