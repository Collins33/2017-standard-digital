The high court has stopped ODM from conducting repeat nominations in 7 polling centres in Suba constituency, a day after the political parties disputes tribunal ordered so. Justice Aggrey Muchelule Saturday issued the orders following an application by aspirant Caroli Omondi who lost to ODM chairman John Mbadi. Omondi now wants the high court to declare him the winner of the disputes polls on grounds that his rival claimed victory through fraud. Justice Muchelule issued the temporary orders and is set to hear the matter Sunday at 11 am in Milimani, Nairobi. On Friday the PPDT gave ODM 72 hours to repeat the exercise in 7 polling centres which are in Mbadi&#39;s stronghold, which had recorded over 100 percent voter turnout. Last Saturday, ODM National Elections Board disregarded it&#39;s own appeals tribunal ruling and declared Mbadi as the winner forcing Omondi to seek reprieve at the PPDT.
