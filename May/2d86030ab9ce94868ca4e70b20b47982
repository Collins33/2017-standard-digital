Governor Isaac Ruto has asked members of the Kalenjin community to vote for NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga, the way they did in 2007. Speaking at Ngesumin in Bureti constituency as he campaigned for his Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) aspirants, Mr Ruto expressed confidence that NASA would get votes in Rift Valley. &quot;Mr Raila Odinga is not a stranger or new presidential candidate in the Rift Valley. Members of the Kalenjin community voted for him in the botched 2007 General Election and are ready to embrace him once more in the August election,&quot; said Ruto. The CCM leader, who is slated to become a deputy premier cabinet secretary if NASA ascends to power, argued that ordinary Kenyans do not care about the tribe or region of a presidential candidate but his or her commitment to devolution. &quot;We no longer want to hear about tribalistic jingoism and other nonsense. What we care about is that we get a leader who is committed to allocating the counties a fair share of the county&#39;s revenue collection,&quot; said Ruto. The Bomet governor, at the same time, petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to provide relief maize to improvised Kenyans in counties. Ruto argued that the Sh90 per packet of 2kg maize flour being sold in supermarkets was out of the reach of poor Kenyans in villages.
