Independence party Kanu has endorsed President&nbsp;Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election bid. At a National Delegates Convention (NDC) in Nairobi on Saturday, the party&rsquo;s rank and file resolved to rally behind President Kenyatta and his Jubilee Party in the coming General Election.&nbsp; Kanu chairman and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi said the party was thrilled to host the President at its NDC, saying as a former chairman of the party,&nbsp;Uhuru&nbsp;had returned home. &ldquo;This (Kanu) is your home. We have walked together and done a lot. You went for a journey but I knew you will be back home. We expect and we ask God that come August 8, Kenyans will re-elect you as President,&rdquo; said Gideon. Secretary General Nick Salat said the resolution by delegates to support&nbsp;Uhuru&nbsp;was binding. &ldquo;We propose to adopt that the National Executive Committee decision to support the candidature of President Kenyatta for the 2017 election,&rdquo; Salat said to a thunderous applause.

His deputy William Ruto did not attend the event. The ecstatic party supporters danced to various tunes alongside the President, Senator Moi and Salat, as he settled and exchanged pleasantries with his former &lsquo;buddies&rsquo; and acquaintances. Salat thrilled delegates with his signature declaration of &ldquo;Tuko ndani, ndani, ndani kabisa&rdquo; (Do not doubt it, we are part and parcel of this)&rdquo;. Back home &ldquo;I&rsquo;m home. I am home where I was born politically. I am happy to be back home. In this stadium (Kasarani) we have done a lot. Today I am back to humbly ask you (delegates) to support my quest and help me continue uniting Kenyans through development,&rdquo; President Kenyatta told delegates. He went on: &ldquo;If you hear me say I want to change the lives of Kenyans, I can&rsquo;t do it alone. The manifesto of Kanu is uniting Kenyans. Former President Moi stressed peace, love and unity as our slogan. Out of respect, I ask for your support,&rdquo; adding: &ldquo;When I form government, Kanu itakuwa ndani ndani kabisa ya serikali. Wacha tuingishe kabisa. Be in the forefront to preach peace, we don&rsquo;t want violence. Kanu tuka pamoja.&rdquo; The response was overwhelming that the President posed for a minute in acknowledgement. &ldquo;I promise one thing, we are not those people (NASA) looking for jobs for four men. We are looking for jobs for youth in the entire republic. I want to finish the development projects initiated by my government,&rdquo; he pledged, downing the Kanu trademark cap. Senator Moi took issue with propaganda doing rounds that Kanu is not part of Jubilee. ALSO READ: If Sonko can get that makeover, you too can... and this is how &ldquo;Your presence affirms it. We are part and parcel of this government,&rdquo; said Moi. He continued: &ldquo;When you form your new government, you will know how to plan.&rdquo;
