National Super Alliance (NASA) leaders have expressed confidence of winning the August 2017 general election in order to change the lives of Kenyans and reduce the cost of living. The leaders urged voters including the sick in hospitals to come out in large numbers and vote for change during the August general election to ensure NASA takes over power. Speaking during a political rally in Kakamega at Bukhungu Stadium on Saturday, the NASA leaders led by Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Masyoka, Musalia Mudavadi, Moses Wetangula, Charity Ngilu, Governor Hassan Joho among other opposition leaders accused Jubilee government of leading the country in the wrong direction. NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga said jubilee has failed Kenyans with unfulfilled pledges, overseeing land grabbing, corruption and high cost of living.
