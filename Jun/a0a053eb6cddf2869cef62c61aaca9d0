The High Court has dismissed a case challenging Migori Governor Okoth Obado&#39;s validity as an ODM member after his defection from the People Democratic Party (PDP). Justices Mumbi Ngugi, John Onyiego, and Wilfrida Okwany, sitting in Kisii, ruled that the county chief is legally in office until the next General Election. The petition had been filed by three Migori residents - George Obuya (ODM), George Obonyo (ODM), and Wilson Chacha (PDP), who wanted the seat declared vacant on grounds that Obado was a member of two parties.&nbsp;
