President Uhuru Kenyatta will today lead the nation in celebrating the last Madaraka Day before the August General Election. Madaraka Day is a milestone in Kenya&#39;s history, for it marks the time Kenyans got self-rule in 1964. Kenya&#39;s nascent leadership at the time had a clear vision for the country. It identified three key areas that had to be tackled immediately to accord its citizens the respect they deserved after so much struggle; poverty, illiteracy and hunger. Yet today so much still remains unaccomplished. Self-rule did not simply entail a change of guard. It was all about decency and a better life for the common man. On balance, that is yet to be fully realised many years later. Nonetheless, August presents Kenyans with another opportunity to exercise the power of self-governance. All expectations are that they will elect good leaders; those who will put the interest of the country before self. For Kenyans must bear blame for the leaders they have, criticised by many for ignoring their plight. It is our hope that things play out differently this year. In truth, there are many who feel that despite self-governance, vested interests still determine how they are governed. Most Kenyans had their heads in the clouds in 1963; they believed that after Kenya&#39;s flag was hoisted to replace the Union Jack this would be a land dripping with milk and honey. Over time, those illusions have evaporated. But it is never too late, the adoption of a new Constitution has in many ways given back that hope: there is greater transparency and accountability in public office. While Devolution, an equaliser of sorts, has revolutionalised the governance landscape and put the people at the centre of decision-making. Yet despite that, corruption, insecurity, food shortages and tribalism still bedevil the country and sully that feeling of self-governance. Evidently, there still remains a lot of heavy-lifting to be done, but it is better done now than never.
