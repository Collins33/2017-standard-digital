The Opposition alliance will today begin a vote-hunting mission in parts of Rift Valley, upper Eastern and Central regions. The National Super Alliance (NASA) principals led by its presidential candidate Raila Odinga will tomorrow pitch tent in Kajiado County with planned rallies in Namanga and Loitokitok. Coming on the heels of the unveiling of an expanded national presidential campaign steering committee last week, Raila is keen on persuading the Maa community to back his bid after they voted for President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto in 2013. Raila unveiled Musalia Mudavadi as the head of presidential campaign team. Mudavadi will be backed by regional coordinators who will be tasked with ensuring that Raila clinches the presidency in his fourth attempt. In Kajiado, Raila is banking on the services of youthful lawmaker Elijah Memusi (Kajiado Central), Governor David Nkedianye and Tarayia ole Kores who recently decamped to the Orange party after he lost the gubernatorial nomination race to former Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph ole Lenku. Mr Kores, a former Olkejuado County Council chairman, announced that he would drum up support for Raila and all NASA candidates in Kajiado. Kores&#39;s exit from Jubilee is a win for NASA considering that he is politically influential among the Maa Community. On Wednesday, the Nasa team will be in Narok South (Narosura) and later hold a rally in Narok town to woo the Maasai to vote for Raila in the August 8th polls.
