Saudi Arabia&#39;s General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) has revoked the license of Qatar Airways and ordered its offices to be closed within 48 hours, the regulatory body said in a statement. Any licenses granted to Qatar Airways employees would also be withdrawn, the statement said. The move comes a day after GACA banned all Qatari planes from landing in the kingdom&#39;s airports, following the worst rift in years among the Gulf countries.
