Alternative access TransUnion Kenya Chief Executive Billy Owino said the Mobile Score Card would enable lenders access predictive and customised risk views while offering consumers alternative access to credit and an opportunity to build a positive credit score. This wil be made possible by making use of mobile lending platforms. He added that the mobile money ecosystem has outgrown necessity-based transactions and peer-to-peer lending and is now transiting into mobile credit and loans. &ldquo;Today, Kenyans perform more transactions on mobile platforms than they do inside banks,&rdquo; said Mr Owino during the new product&rsquo;s launch in Nairobi. &ldquo;Transacting with conventional banks can be difficult, as many banks require documentation such as payslips and credit history in order to apply for credit or transactional accounts,&rdquo; he said.
