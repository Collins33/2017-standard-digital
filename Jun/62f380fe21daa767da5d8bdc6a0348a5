Murang&#39;a Governor Mwangi wa Iria was Thursday cleared to seek re-election a day after a local resident went to the High Court, seeking to block his clearance. He presented his nomination papers to Murang&#39;a County returning officer Joseph Mukewa Thursday. He had earlier indicated that he would present his papers today. He was escorted to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission offices by his running mate and former Kandara MP James Maina Kamau. After he was cleared he left for Nyeri for the Madaraka Day celebrations without addressing the public, as is his habit. On Wednesday, Jackson Kiroko Ndegwa went to the High Court in Nairobi, seeking to bar the commission from clearing wa Iria over alleged integrity issues. One of the governor&#39;s aides said they had to seek the clearance early to avoid &#39;emerging issues&#39;.

At the same time, Kangema parliamentary Jubilee Party nominee Muturi Kigano has been cleared by IEBC. While addressing residents at Gakira market, Mr Kigano said he would ensure that residents are empowered socially and economically. He urged fellow politicians to conduct peaceful campaigns. &quot;I have waited to get the parliamentary seat for 43 years and that patience must be emulated by the youth,&quot; he said. Four members of Parliament in Murang&#39;a lost their bids to defend their seats on a Jubilee Party ticket in the nominations. Only Kandara MP Alice Wahome survived the onslaught after she polled 27,175 votes to defeat her eight rivals who included two former MPs.
