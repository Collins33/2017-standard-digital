The killing of Mumias Sugar Company secretary Ronald Lubya has yet again exposed a disturbing trend propagated by politicians seeking political mileage. In death, even before the body of a prominent Kenyan turns cold, politicians would be on overdrive, spewing all manner of theories in total disregard to grieving family and friends. Comments attributed to leaders, who should know better, alleging knowledge of Lubya&#39;s killers are callous and insensitive. It is a worrying and warped thinking that perpetrates similar trends in the past when Prof Odhiambo Mbai, Prof George Saitoti, Mutula Kilonzo, Otieno Kajwang and most recently Jacob Juma, died in unclear circumstances. Politicising these killings only serves to fatten the red-herring, thus driving any efforts for an investigation off tangent. The reason police cordon off a scene of crime is to ensure any clues that could help establish exactly what happened are not tampered with. If there should be comments or leads that would help bring perpetrators to justice, the established procedure is to report to relevant authorities. Granted, this country has witnessed myriad politically motivated killings and most have not been resolved. However understandable the anger that follows such suspicious deaths is, it does not justify throwing around unhelpful theories which, in any case, do not aid in sustaining a prosecution. Leaders making these allegations know it too. It highlights the shedding of crocodile tears by a people eager to profit from a crass society, without the intention of solving the problem.
