Kiprop Bundotich alias Buzeki says he will continue to vie for Uasin Gishu governor seat as an independent candidate. Deputy President Wi?liam Ruto had earlier asked Mr. Bundotich to shelve his bid and fall behind incumbent Governor Jackson Mandago.

Buzeki however stood his ground and rejected the proposition saying he will not step out of the race. He insisted that he is not a Jubilee project.&nbsp; ALSO READ: 10 million votes is a pipe dream, Ruto tells NASA
