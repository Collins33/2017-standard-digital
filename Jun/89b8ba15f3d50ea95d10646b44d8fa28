A new study has concluded that chewing of&nbsp;miraa&nbsp;results in poor academic performance. The study by Hawasa University in Ethiopia, which is published in the current issue of the journal African Health Sciences, was conducted in the&nbsp;miraa-growing&nbsp;area of Sidama in the southern part of the country. African Health Sciences&nbsp;is an international refereed journal supported by the US National Institutes of Health. The findings come four months after Kenyan researchers surprised the scientific community by declaring&nbsp;miraa&nbsp;safe for human consumption. They also come at a time when the Government has written to the United Nations over Europe&#39;s decision to ban the stimulant from its market.

Buoyed by these findings, Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett recently told&nbsp;miraa&nbsp;farmers that the Government had petitioned the United Nations over the European ban of&nbsp;miraa. Kenya, he said, was seeking an interpretation of a convention on drug trade that European nations had used to ban the exports. &quot;If the interpretation favours Kenya that&nbsp;miraa&nbsp;is not a psychotic drug, then the Government will ask these countries to remove the restrictions,&quot; Mr Bett told&nbsp;miraafarmers in Nyambene. If the UN takes up the Kenyan petition, it may establish a technical panel to study available scientific data and make a decision in favour or against&nbsp;miraa. The Ethiopian study could very well be part of the documents to be perused.

This is interesting considering that the students said they chewed&nbsp;miraa&nbsp;to stay awake and get energised to study. The Ethiopian findings are similar to those of another study in Saudi Arabia which also found that&nbsp;miraa&nbsp;chewing affects academic performance. The research also links its findings to previous laboratory work at the University of Minnesota, US, which showed chronic use of khat to have long term effects on human memory.

Interestingly, several studies conducted in Kenya universities in Kenya also linked local&nbsp;miraa&nbsp;to poor academic performance. A 2013 unpublished study by Daniel JN Ngeranwa of Kenyatta University found worrying levels of khat-chewing among upper primary pupils in Gachoka sub-county in Embu. The results revealed about 10 per cent of pupils in Kianjiru zone chewed&nbsp;miraa. The study said it impacted negatively on educational performance of the pupils where the boys were more adversely affected than the girls. An earlier study by Samuel Thuo Kimani of the University of Nairobi and published in the journal&nbsp;Behavioural Brain Research&nbsp;showed khat has serious negative effects on learning and memory when fed on experimental mice. The chemical cathinone in khat, the Kimani study argued, works through the same mechanism as the powerful stimulant called amphetamine to impair learning and memory. Cathinone acts like amphetamine, a major reason why&nbsp;miraa&nbsp;has been banned in Europe. [email&#160;protected]
