The Government has trained 349 Kenyans in oil exploration over the past four years, according&nbsp;Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri. In a speech read on his behalf by Fisheries Principal Secretary Japheth Ntiba Micheni at a conference in Kakamega, the CS said the training cost&nbsp;Sh480 million. He said those trained were drawn from various Government agencies. Kiunjuri said those trained will help in development of gas and oil exploration in Turkana and along the Great Rift Valley. By the end of 2015, a total of 74 oil exploration wells had been drilled. &quot;Another 17 new exploration blocks were created increasing the number to 46 from 36. Some 36 blocks have been licensed to 18 international companies and this will streamline economic growth through creation of more jobs,&quot; said Kiunjuri.
