Police are looking for a gang that raided a voter verification centre in Kariobangi and robbed Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) staff of cash and valuables. Two gunmen walked into Nairobi River Primary School in Kariobangi South posing as voters seeking to verify their details with the IEBC team. Witnesses said one of the two men produced a gun and ordered the four IEBC staff to lie down and surrender their valuables and cash. They then grabbed mobile phones, handbags, an unknown amount of cash and a power bank belonging to IEBC. Police say the gang escaped from the scene and efforts to trace them were ongoing. Some of the IEBC staff have urged for security at their centres because they are sometimes harassed by people posing as voters. &quot;Sometimes we are also harassed by voters who cannot find their names in the register,&quot; said a member of the team. Police boss Japheth Koome said they were investigating the attack. The voter verification exercise is scheduled to end on June 9. Meanwhile, a 20-year-old student was found dead in a trench in Kibera. Police suspect he was murdered.&nbsp;
