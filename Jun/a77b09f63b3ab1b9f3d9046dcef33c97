Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto has mounted a campaign to counter the recent visit by President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Jubilee brigade to the county. The Chama Cha Mashinani party leader, while addressing a rally at Chemaner, said residents have nothing celebrate about the Jubilee leaders tour to the area. President Kenyatta failed to commission the tarmacking of Chemaner-Tegat-Longisa-Kipreres road as was widely expected. &ldquo;It was meant to blind fold locals into believing Jubilee was here with development goodies but it emerged that they were only interested in votes and we are going to say no,&rdquo; Ruto said and told locals to shun Jubilee. He also toured areas that were skipped by the President along the Sotik-Bomet highway. ALSO READ: Leaders spend sleepless nights trying to lock Jubilee out of Western
