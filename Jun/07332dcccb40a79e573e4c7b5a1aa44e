Those caught with the tusks told police they were headed for Hong Kong where the owners had paid for their shipment. Police tracked the men to the two bedroomed house where the ivory had been cut into pieces and packaged ready for shipment following a tip off.

This gives an indication the illegal business in ivory is still rampant despite thorough policing and stiff penalties on those caught. The operation was carried out by various government agencies. Two months ago two men were arrested after they were found with 117 kilograms of ivory in Tseikuru, Kitui County. The arrest comes at a time when various agencies are investigating the March 2017 seizure of ivory weighing 117 kgs in Hanoi, Vietnam. The Hanoi seizure was later traced back to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Recent trends show that the far eastern countries continue to present a lucrative market for ivory and other wildlife trophies. More suspects are being sought and under investigations &ldquo;This is giving a signal of continued killing of elephants in the country,&rdquo; said Katumo. This is despite the campaign to stop the crime. ALSO READ: Study: 'Devil' poses grave danger to Mara wildlife
