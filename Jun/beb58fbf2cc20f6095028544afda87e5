The Nairobi Jubilee team has said governor aspirant Peter&nbsp;Kenneth&nbsp;is being fronted by the Opposition. Led by Mike Sonko, who is vying for the gubernatorial seat on a Jubilee ticket, they said Mr&nbsp;Kenneth&nbsp;was a NASA project. Flanked by Senate aspirant Johnson Sakaja and Woman Rep Rachael Shebesh, Sonko accused&nbsp;Kenneth&nbsp;of working to spoil Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s votes.&nbsp;
