The High Court has lifted warrant of arrest issued against Nakuru County Governor Kinuthia Mbugua. The warrant was issued after he disobeyed a court order that directed him to pay six former employees their wages. Justice Monica Mbaru of the Employment and Labor Relations Court Monday lifted the warrant after Mbugua&#39;s lawyer Tom Ojienda told the court that they have complied with an order requiring them to pay those aggrieved. Mbaru had earlier ordered for the immediate arrest of the governor and county officials Motari Mogusi and Joseph Mbugua following a pay row with former county employees. Justice Mbaru had said that the three should be arrested with speed by the officer commanding police station Nakuru and be produced in court on or before June 13, 2017. The said orders were issued after Mbugua, Joseph Motari Mogusi (Secretary Nakuru County) and Joseph Mbugua (Nakuru County Public Service Board) failed to appear in court to show cause why they should not be committed to civil jail. &nbsp; ALSO READ: County fails to collect waste after Governor Kinuthia Mbugua was voted out in primaries The judge had said that the three failed to comply with the summons issued on 5 June 2017.
