That all is not well at the multi-billion Dominion Farm at Yalla swamp in Siaya County is no longer a secret. Workers have not been paid their salaries for five months now. Grape vine has it that the company with its headquarters in Oklahoma, US, could be planning to relocate to another African country. A senior executive of the company has not been seen at its Siaya offices for several months now and his whereabouts is the subject of discussion in the town. Now workers fear that their lives will be turned upside down should the irrigation giant relocated. &nbsp;
