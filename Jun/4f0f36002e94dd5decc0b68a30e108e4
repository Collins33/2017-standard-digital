The National Super Alliance (NASA) has released its week-long schedule of campaigns for this week. The Opposition&#39;s presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka will be joined by Moses Wetang&#39;ula, Musalia Mudavadi and Isaac Ruto to campaign in Kajiado today. Raila will be back in Kajiado County, a week after he is alleged to have incited the Maasai community against non-Maasai. Raila however said he told them not to sell their land. The NASA team will hold rallies in Oloitokitok, Kimaana and Kitengela. Jubilee leaders have called for Raila&#39;s arrest but he insisted he did nothing wrong. He repeated that he had only asked the Maasai not to sell their land. &quot;We continue asking those who are registered as proprietors to stop selling land that they hold in trust. This is what we were urging in Kajiado...,&quot; Raila said. But Kajiado West MP Moses Sakuda warned NASA, saying:&nbsp; &quot;We are aware that NASA principals are scheduled to tour Kajiado County today again. We demand that they keep off the matter to cool down tensions already spreading across the cosmopolitan county.&quot; ALSO READ: Raila, Uhuru back to hot land debate The Nasa team will campaign in Naivasha tomorrow while on Thursday they will split into two teams.
