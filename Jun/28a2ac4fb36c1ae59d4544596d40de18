Safaricom will be upgrading its M-PESA platform for a period of two hours today from 1am to 3pm which will result to a suspension of services during that time. The mobile service provider will again in mid-July be conducting a changeover to the new platform for a 12 hour period which will result to another outage. At the same time, International Money Transfer (IMT), KCB M-PESA, M-Shwari and M-Kesho services will be unavailable on 15 July again for a period of two hours, from 1am to 3pm. The platforms will be undergoing regular service. &nbsp;&quot;Ten years ago, we began the journey of M-PESA by focusing on our customers&#39; need to send money home. Since then, we have experienced tremendous growth as the platform has grown to provide even more value to the ecosystem. This upgrade paves the way for the next phase of M-PESA and will enable the service deliver even more value for our customers and partners,&quot; said Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore.
