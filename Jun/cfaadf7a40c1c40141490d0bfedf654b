Kenya&#39;s capital markets regulator said on Tuesday that it had not received any notification about a proposed acquisition by KCB Group of a stake in National Bank of Kenya. In last week&rsquo;s documents KCB had proposed taking over National Bank through a share swap, saying it would initially take over 70 percent of its shares, before announcing its offer for the remaining stake. &quot;We wish to clarify that no regulatory filings have been made to the Authority by KCB Group regarding this matter and no confirmation of the existence of such a transaction has been received,&quot; the Capital Markets Authority said in a statement. KCB&#39;s Chief Executive Joshua Oigara confirmed that the bank had sent an expression of interest in acquiring a controlling stake in NBK to the finance ministry but offered no more details. Kenya&#39;s banking sector is experiencing consolidation after the closure of three lenders last year exposed weaknesses caused by lapses in corporate governance.
