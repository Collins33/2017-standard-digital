Police are looking for the owner of the seven-storey building the collapsed in Kware, Embakasi area, Nairobi for questioning. Officers handling the incident said the owner is yet to be located and that he had switched off his mobile phones. Nairobi police boss Japheth Koome asked the owner to surrender to local police for formal processing. &quot;It is important for him to surrender to police for formal questioning. People have died and others are injured,&quot; said Koome. Two people had been pulled out of the rubble alive while two others were found dead by Wednesday afternoon. There were more than 120 people who were evacuated from the building before it collapsed. Koome said 130 tenants had been accounted for, but they could not establish how many people had been living there. He said rescuers had evacuated tenants occupying neighbouring buildings. Nairobi Governor said the structure was built in 2007 and that there was no official approval. &#39;This was one of the buildings that had been marked for demolition but because of many issues including security we could not manage,&quot; he said. He added some owners had moved to court for orders to stop the demolition of their houses after they were found to be faulty. Rescuers said they expected to finish their work by tomorrow. It was not clear if there were survivors therein. It has emerged some of those trapped there refused to leave even after being warned the structure was weak and collapsing.
