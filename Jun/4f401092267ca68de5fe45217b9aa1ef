Jubilee MPs address the media at Parliament Buildings. [Moses Omusula, Standard] Members of Parliament allied to Jubilee Party have accused National Super Alliance (NASA) flag bearer Raila Odinga of being malicious in his constant attacks against the electoral commission. Led by National Assembly Leader of Majority Aden Duale, the MPs claimed Raila was bitter with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) bosses after they rejected a bid by a firm owned by his friends to provide ballot papers. Dubai-based Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing LLC clinched the lucrative Sh2.5 billion tender, beating South African Printing firm Paarl Media (Pty) Ltd, which unsuccessfully protested the decision before the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board (PPARB). Speaking at a press briefing in Parliament Thursday, Mr Duale, accompanied by other Jubilee legislators, sensationally linked Raila to Paarl Media proprietors, claiming they were great friends. &quot;We want Raila to come clean on his relationship with Ben Sachs and Patel Shailesh, proprietors of Paarl Media. We know they met in his office thrice in December of 2015 and twice in April 2016,&quot; said Duale.
