Opposition candidate Raila Odinga has sustained his onslaught against the electoral agency, alleging there was a scheme to print excess ballot papers to manipulate the poll outcome in favour of President Uhuru Kenyatta. He accused Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) bosses, particularly its chief executive officer Ezra Chiloba, of working in cahoots with Jubilee to rig the elections. &quot;Chiloba, please stop assisting Jubilee to rig the elections. We can&#39;t accept Al Ghurair to print ballot papers. There are plans to print excess ballot papers to manipulate the polls,&quot; said Raila. Raila maintained the National Super Alliance (NASA) would not allow Dubai firm Al Ghurair to print ballot papers for the August 8 General Election. He spoke at Kihumbuini Grounds in Kangemi where he asked NASA supporters to turn out in large numbers to vote out Uhuru and his deputy William Ruto. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has maintained that the Al Ghurair deal was above aboard and that all parties were consulted before it was awarded.
