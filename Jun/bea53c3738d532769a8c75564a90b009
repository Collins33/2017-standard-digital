Kenya has been ranked among the worst countries in the world when it comes to protecting children from cyber-bullying. According to a report by International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the country has not achieved much in protecting minors from online bullies. The ITU report said despite being one of the leading users of the internet on the continent, Kenya had scored zero in protecting children from online dangers. The report is divided into legislation specific to child pornography, child pornography defined, computer-facilitated offences, simple possession and internal service provider reporting. Kenya scored zero in every category. South Africa and the US met all the conditions. Following the report, the Kenya Film Classification Board has organised a workshop for stakeholders to address the matter.&nbsp; &nbsp; ALSO READ: G7 invite an endorsement of President Uhuru&rsquo;s foreign policy
