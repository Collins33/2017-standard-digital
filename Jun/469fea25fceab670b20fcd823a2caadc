Court has temporarily reinstated the Managing director of Kenya Airport Authority Board Yatich Kangugo. While delivering the ruling, Judge Hellen Wasilwa ordered the company to reinstate him pending the hearing and determination over his removal from office. &quot;The claimant has been turned into an object of ridicule contrary to fair labor practice as guaranteed in the constitution&quot; the court heard. Wasilwa said that the board has not complied with the orders of the court issued on 31 May 2017. Yatich moved to court through his lawyer Danson Omari and told the judge that the management of KPA is yet to obey and reinstate him to his position. Omari in court documents said that Yatich has continuously been harassed and turned out by the management to detriment of the orders of the court. Yatich requested the court to issue further orders restraining the board from running parallel proceedings apart from the ones filed in court which the judge has duly issued orders of reinstatement. He said that since the court issued the orders, the Board has been harassing and bullying the claimant with the sole purpose of frustrating justice. The board has severally issued letter to show cause by the claimant, which action amount into intimidation and abuse of power &nbsp;The judge directed that the main application by the claimant be heard on July 13.
