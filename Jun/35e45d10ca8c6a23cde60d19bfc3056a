More than 80 people have been arrested in an anti-terror operation in Eastleigh. The 88 suspects include 15 foreigners and are now interrogating them for among others radicalisation and being involved in a human trafficking racket. Police said they raided different rehabilitation centres where the victims were staying before driving away with them. Officials from DCI headquarters and those from anti-terrorism police were involved in the dawn operation. The victims were detained in separate police stations and are expected to appear in court soon. This comes in the wake of heightened police operations aimed at taming terror attacks, radicalism and human trafficking. Terrorists have killed at least 35 people in the past one month in attacks carried out in North eastern and Lamu. Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery said the terror attacks witnessed were as a result of the locals colluding with terrorists.
