The case filed at the same court failed to proceed due to lack of witnesses involving the Chief of staff, Willy Malile (Mbooni sub-county admistrator), Mr. Urbanus Wambua and Mr. Keffa Amos an enforcement officer who were being accused of threatening to beat the now Mavoko constituency candidate and former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile last year March 26 at Darajani village within Makueni County. Following the incident, they were arraigned at Makindu courts where they pleaded not guilty and released on Sh10,000 cash bail on April 4, 2016. The case was slated same year July 11 but failed to take off because the magistrate was engaged in other activities. In subsequent dates set by the Makindu law courts the case could not take off since Kalembe Ndile, Kyalo Laiti (Former Mtito-Andei Mayor), Peterson Ngari and Ms. Judy Wavinya lined as key witnesses in the pre-trial failed to turn up and testify in Court.
