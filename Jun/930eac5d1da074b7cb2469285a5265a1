Kenya will offer Sh75b ($750 million) in guarantees to Kenya Airways&#39; existing creditors to help the heavily-indebted carrier secure financing from other sources to complete its recovery, a cabinet document showed on Tuesday. The guarantees, approved by the cabinet, will cover $525 million owed to the U.S. Exim Bank and the rest to local lenders, said the document seen by Reuters. The airline, partly-owned by Air France KLM and the Kenyan government, has struggled to return to profit after tourist traffic slumped four years ago following a spate of attacks by Somalia-based Islamist militants. The government will also convert its existing loans to the carrier into equity, it said. It was not immediately clear how much it has lent the carrier, but a source at the airline said it was a &quot;significant&quot; amount lent over time. The plan to guarantee the existing debt will be taken to the National Assembly for approval, the government said. &quot;The guarantees would be in exchange for material concessions to be provided as part of the financial restructuring which would secure future funding for the company,&quot; the cabinet document said, without giving details on the concessions.

The debt owed to the U.S Exim bank is related to the financing of the purchase of the carrier&#39;s Boeing planes. Kenya Airways says the financial restructuring will involve restructuring debt and securing additional capital to help dig itself out of a position of negative equity, and attain a better balance between cash flow and debt repayments.
