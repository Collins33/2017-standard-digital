Thousands of&nbsp;Kerio&nbsp;Valley residents who donated land for the mining of fluorspar will finally be&nbsp;compensated. The national government Sunday announced that plans for the payouts were at an advanced stage. President Uhuru Kenyatta directed that those affected by fluorspar mining should be&nbsp;compensated&nbsp;in two weeks&#39; time. &quot;I have directed Ministry of Mining officials led by Cabinet Secretary Dan Kazungu to visit the area next week and address the longstanding issue,&quot; said Uhuru at a campaign rally at Chepkorio in Keiyo South constituency. The Government is expected to spend at least Sh1 billion to pay more than 20,000 people. &quot;The affected families will receive their dues in about two weeks&#39; time, after the ministry compiles the list of beneficiaries. The compiling must be expedited because the Jubilee administration is committed to the welfare of all Kenyans,&quot; he said.
