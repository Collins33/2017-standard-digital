MALINDI, KENYA: Four people have been arrested in Malindi for selling the subsidised maize flour at an exaggerated price of Sh120. Police officers attached to the Malindi police station laid a crackdown after complaints from the public and arrested the suspects at separate shops within Malindi town. The national government has subsidized the maize flour which was retailing at the most high price of Sh. 150 and reduced it to Sh. 90. Malindi police boss Matawa Muchangi said that detectives disguised as customers arrested the traders. &quot;After we received complaints from the public our detectives posed as customers at the shops and were told to pay Sh. 120 for the 2 kilogram of Taifa maize and that is when they arrested the retailers,&quot; he said. The government had ordered the millers to brand the &#39;GOK sh. 90&#39; label on all maize flour being sold in the market. Mr Muchangi said the suspects, identified as Mr Ali Hassan, Mr Maurice Mureithi, Mr Joyce Bula and Mr Silas Muema will be taken to court and charged with an offence under the Price Control Act of 2011. &nbsp;
