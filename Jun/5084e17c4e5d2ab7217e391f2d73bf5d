One more suspect has been arrested in connection to the killing of three children of Kapsoya MCA aspirant James Ratemo. Uasin Gishu County Criminal Investigations Officer Peter Kiswii said evidence gathered indicated the man who was arrested in a neighbouring county was linked to the first suspect. He said the suspect was being held at a police station in Eldoret. &ldquo;The suspect was arrested by local police detectives and experts from the homicide department in a joint swoop after analysis of critical information linked him to the first suspect,&rdquo; he said He said another suspect closely linked to the case was still at large. According to Mr Kiswii, the evidence pieced together so far could sustain a murder trial against the key suspects.
