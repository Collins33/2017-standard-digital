The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) said Lawy was relieved of his duties due to delayed sourcing of ballot papers. Mr. Aura is the second director to leave the electoral body as the struggle between Commission and Secretariat plays out. Director for&nbsp;ICT James Muhati was sent on a compulsory leave by the Commission on May 26 following accusations that he had refused to cooperate in an ongoing audit of ICT systems. The decision to out him was reached at the plenary meeting chaired by chairman Wafula Chebukati and attended by all commissioners and CEO Ezra Chiloba. Chebukati personally signed the memo sending Muhati home for a month and appointed manager Chris Msando as the acting director. ALSO READ: Five in battle for Lamu woman rep seat
