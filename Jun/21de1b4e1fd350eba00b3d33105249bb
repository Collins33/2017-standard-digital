National Super Alliance (NASA) leaders&nbsp;have urged supporters to be vigilant to curb rigging during the elections. Addressing ODM supporters on Sunday, Governor Amason Kingi said he would ensure that Jubilee Party lost in the region. &nbsp;&quot;I want to urge every supporter to identify a polling station and adopt it to ensure that our rivals do not have an avenue for rigging the elections,&quot; he said. &quot;The journey has officially begun. Together with my Mombasa colleague we will ensure that Jubilee does not get a single vote from this region.&quot;&nbsp;
