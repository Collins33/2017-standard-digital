Two women teams have been formed in Nyanza to spearhead campaigns for Opposition leader Raila Odinga. Christened &#39;Warembo Na Raila&#39; and &#39;Wamama Na Raila&#39;, the teams target to mobilise women to market the presidential candidate ahead of the August 8 polls with the clarion call, &#39;Raila Tosha&#39;. According to the leaders, Caren Aketch and deputy governor Ruth Odinga, the teams expect women to win over friends and voters to support Raila&#39;s bid for State House. &quot;We want women to shed their egos and work with us for the benefit of Raila, who enjoys national-wide support,&quot; said Ms Aketch.
