A man in Lirhende village, Kakamega County, chopped off his father&rsquo;s right hand after they differed over campaign posters of two ward aspirants. Area assistant chief Alex Minish said Chrisantus Mwinamo, who is still at large, had engaged his brother Cedrick Vihembo in a physical fight for destroying the campaign posters of Edwin Papala, an ODM candidate. Vihembo is a strong supporter of area ODM candidate while his brother campaigns for Federal Party of Kenya candidate Silas Shihenzi. The two were separated by members of the public. But later in the evening, Mwinamo attacked his father Protus Mugaisi with a panga, chopping off his right hand and injuring his brother. Mugaisi is admitted to St Elizabeth&rsquo;s Mukumu Hospital. He told Saturday Standard that Mwinamo came home at around 7.30pm on Thursday drunk and attacked them. &ldquo;We were taking supper when he came with a panga and started slashing us. I was sitting at the main door and he chopped off my right hand when I tried to confront him. He also injured his brother and other family members,&rdquo; said Mugaisi Mugaisi said it&rsquo;s not the first time the suspect had meted violence on his family.
