Trade Cabinet Secretary Adan Mohamed has said Kenya will seek to secure deals on fisheries, agriculture and services at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Eleventh Ministerial Conference to be held in Argentina later this year. He was speaking at the WTO in Paris, France last week where trade ministers met to discuss the global trade agenda. &ldquo;A number of issues such as agriculture, services, fish subsidies, MSMEs, E-Commerce, investment facilitation and the importance of development in international trade are cross-cutting among many nations, and Kenya is not an exception,&rdquo; Mr Mohamed said. The meeting focused on addressing WTO&rsquo;s role in advancing trade and global growth inclusively, assessing success areas for the upcoming MC11 in Argentina in December 2017 and ensuring that trade negotiators are well-instructed. Mr Mohamed held talks with the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, WTO Director General Roberto Azev&ecirc;do and several trade ministers. Faced with emerging global trade developments such as Brexit and unclear path on global trade in the medium to short term, WTO members are keen to sustain global trade growth.
