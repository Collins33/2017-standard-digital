Nyando MP and Kisumu Senate ODM candidate, Mr Fred Outa had to fire shots into the air as he escaped from a hostile mourners after chaos erupted at a funeral in his constituency. Mr Outa&#39;s bodyguards also fired several shots to save him from the surging crowd that also smashed his car windows during the scuffle that disrupted the burial of former area MP, Miruka Owuor for several hours yesterday. Outa&#39;s car&#39;s windscreen had what looked like a bullet hole and police were last evening examining it to establish who could have fired the bullet. Kisumu Police County Commander, Titus Yoma, said they had an intelligence of an impending chaos at the funeral and had posted many officers at the home near Ahero town. The chaos was the culmination of tension that had been building at the funeral between supporters of Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) and those of Independendent candidates. The charged mourners had earlier heckled those advocating for the six-piece suit voting pattern in the August polls, saying they should be left to vote for candidates of their choice. Trouble started after Mr Outa stood from his seat and approached the dais where a Member of Kisumu County Assembly for Wawidhi ward , Mr Moses Ochele was criticizing him. As he approached Ochele, mourners started shouting at him, saying: Ok ibi wuoyo ka! &quot;Ok Ibiwuoyo ka! (You will not speak here). Hell then broke loose, with some mourners trying to hit Mr Outa with plastic chairs. He quickly whipped out a pistol and fired into the air, sending they would be attackers dashing for cover. In a bid to save him, his bodyguards also fired into the air as they whisked him away amid deafening jeers. In the process, some mourners smashed his car windscreen. Outa is the ODM nominee for the Kisumu senate seat and is facing stiff opposition from Ochola Ogoda who is campaigning as an Independent candidate. [email&#160;protected]
