NAIROBI, KENYA: It will be difficult to manage the ballooning public debt after the polls, Musalia Mudavadi now claims. The Amani National Congress leader said it will be a tall order for the incoming government after the August elections to manage the debt. He said controlling the public debt will be a major issue for any government adding that the growth of the debt has reached unmanageable levels. Mudavadi said as Opposition, they are worried with the country&#39;s debt levels claiming it cast a dark image of the country&#39;s economic future. The public debt in 2015 nearly doubled to Sh2.6 trillion from Sh1.4 trillion debt in 2011, according to data from the 2016 Economic Survey. He faulted the Government of inflating the cost of key projects with the extra cash landing in private pockets.
