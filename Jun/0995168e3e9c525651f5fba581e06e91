Plan includes door-to-door campaigns and meetings with professionals, church leaders, elders and youth. The Raila Odinga Presidential Campaign team in Nyanza has hit the ground running with a promise to deliver a six-piece suit voting pattern even as independent candidates plot a counter-offensive. The regional team leader, Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga, Friday announced &ldquo;a mother of all campaigns&rdquo; to deliver a 100 per cent voter turnout for Raila and ODM in the region. Wanga unveiled her team&rsquo;s campaign plan, which entails door-to-door vote hunting and organised meetings with party delegates, church leaders, elders, youth and professionals. &ldquo;There is a huge task ahead, we are not underrating the independent candidates. It will be a fierce friendly match, but we must drive these guys out of town. We will not achieve our objectives if we don&rsquo;t deliver six-piece voting pattern,&rdquo; Wanga told Saturday Standard in Kisumu Friday. Wanga&rsquo;s team includes Nominated MP Oburu Oginga, corporate strategist Bob Madanji and former Kasipul Kabondo MP Paddy Ahenda. ALSO READ: Should candidates reveal sources of their campaign cash? She said part of their mission is to reconcile aspirants aggrieved by the ODM nominations and convince them to &ldquo;return home&rdquo;. &ldquo;We will run an issue based campaign. We will send out simple narratives and messages to our people. We want to reconcile our&nbsp; people and speak with one voice because as a community, it is now&nbsp; or never,&rdquo; she said. The campaign team begins its task in Kabondo today, where they will attend church service before meeting more than 500 party delegates, opinion leaders, youth and women leaders. They will also address roadside meetings. Tomorrow they will be in Migori County.
