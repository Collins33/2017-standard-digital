The county is concerned over the high number of uncollected bodies at the Rift Valley Provincial General Hospital mortuary. The department of public health is set to conduct a mass burial of 97 unclaimed bodies, many of them infants. The county took the decision after a 21-day notice to relatives to claim the bodies elapsed. There are 97 unclaimed bodies at the county mortuary out of which only 28 are adults. Level Five hospital morgue has 16 unclaimed corpses. County public health officer Samuel King&#39;ori said the bodies of the infants have been in the mortuary for the past three months.

Some of those whose children die do not collect the bodies.&quot; King&#39;ori attributed this to the fact that some of the mothers cannot afford transport and burial expenses. &quot;The high number of dead bodies at the hospital is attributed to increased deliveries. Some of those who lose their babies do not pick the bodies for burial due to lack of resources,&quot; he said. &quot;Children under the age of five years are the property of the Government. The only option we are left with if their relatives do not collect their bodies is to bury them,&quot; he said.
