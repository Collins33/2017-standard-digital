The Council of Governors has now declared the ongoing nurses&#39; strike unprotected. The governors have also threatened legal action against the union should nurses fail to resume work. In a statement, the council termed the strike illegal and demanded the Kenya National Union of Nurses (Knun) must demonstrates proof of compliance. &quot;Knun must demonstrate proof of compliance with the recognition agreement and Knun constitution within 24 hours failure to which county governments as employers of nurses will take appropriate administrative and legal action. The statement signed by the council&#39;s Human Resources, Labour and Social Welfare chairman James Ongwae states that nurses had not adhered to the recognition agreements, their constitution and prevailing labour relations laws.&nbsp;
