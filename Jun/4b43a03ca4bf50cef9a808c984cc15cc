Some groups have renewed calls for the government to close down all donkey abattoirs in the country. The donkey welfare groups said this would save the dwindling population of the beasts of burden in the area. Officials of the Farming Systems Kenya (FSK) joined over 300 donkey owners in a procession in Narok Town to press for closure of the&nbsp;abattoirs. The protesters also lauded the Government for closing a slaughter house in Naivasha over cruel treatment of donkeys.
