Preparations for a tour by President Uhuru Kenyatta were marred by protests from residents in Maragua over the poor state of the roads. The protesters barricaded roads and demanded that the Government rehabilitate them. They blocked the two roads leading to Maragua town from the busy Murang&#39;a-Kenol highway with stones and boulders and erected barriers at various intersections to bar vehicles from getting through. On Monday night, trucks hired by the county government delivered murram to strategic points in the area.
