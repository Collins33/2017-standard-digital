Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi who is now gunning for governor, has set a record as one of the longest-serving MPs to be re-elected through different parties for each of his five terms in Parliament. The 65-year-old veteran politician, an astute technocrat who was involved in the formation of Jubilee Party, was first elected as MP for South Imenti on a Ford Kenya ticket in 1992. By 1997, the Opposition MP had made up his mind to cross over to the Democratic Party, which had emerged as the strongest outfit in Mt Kenya East. Prior to the 2002 elections, the two-term MP jumped ship to join National Alliance of Kenya, which metamorphosed into the National Rainbow Coalition (Narc) after Kanu &lsquo;rebels&rsquo; joined it in droves. Powerful minister In 2007, Narc had collapsed spectacularly and Kiraitu, by then a powerful minister in the Kibaki government, had been elected secretary general of the Party of National Unity (PNU), through which he sought re-election.

The &lsquo;bus&rsquo; party was among more than 10 parties that last December voluntary collapsed into the Jubilee Party. It is via this ticket that Kiraitu will seek election for a sixth term, this time as Meru governor.&nbsp;
