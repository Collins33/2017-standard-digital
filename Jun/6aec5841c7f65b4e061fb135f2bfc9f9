An estimated 120,000 police and prison personnel have been paid Sh10,000 each as allowances for services rendered during the party primaries. However, the payment has triggered disaffection among Administration Police officers who have been excluded, prompting some officers to accuse their bosses of sabotage. In their June pay slips, some officers have received Sh10,000 which is listed under &#39;unknown&#39;. When they questioned what the money was meant for, police headquarters sent a memo to all officers, saying it was an allowance paid for the services rendered during the party primaries. &quot;Following the successful security coverage of the political parties&#39; primaries and the continued commitment being exhibited by officers to cover political campaign rallies, the Inspector General has authorised the payment of allowances of Sh10,000 to all officers across the board irrespective of their ranks,&quot; read a memo sent to all officers. The memo, dated June 14, said the allowances will be reflected in the June 2017, pay slip. It advised police commanders to inform their juniors and ask them to continue &quot;showing&quot; the same commitment in their duties during the remaining phase of the electioneering period. Police headquarters has moved to calm the AP officers, saying the exclusion was an anomaly and would be rectified as soon as possible and they would also be paid. Wire the allowances &quot;The inconvenience arises from Treasury, and officials are working hard to wire the allowances to your accounts and prior pay slips printed will be invalidated and reprinted ones will be available on the Government Human Resource Information System (GHRIS) Portal,&quot; read an internal memo shared among officers. It is not clear if National Youth Service, Kenya Wildlife Service and Kenya Forest Service, who participated in covering the primaries, will also be paid.
