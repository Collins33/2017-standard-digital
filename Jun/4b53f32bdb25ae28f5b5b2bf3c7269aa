Deputy President William Ruto and several Jubilee leaders intensified their campaigns in Narok County by holding a series of rallies to drum up support for the party ahead of the August elections. The leaders addressed a rally at Murkan, Loita and Oloipil grounds in Narok County yesterday, wooing voters to support Jubilee. They said the more the Opposition talked about Jubilee-initiated projects it confirms that they also value them. Ruto said the Emurua Dikirr hospital project, whose foundation was laid down by President Uhuru Kenyatta would soon be constructed at a cost of Sh200 million, which has been set-aside in this financial year. &quot;Our competitors are trying to associate themselves with our development projects like the&nbsp;SGR&nbsp;because they have nothing to show Kenyans in terms of development,&quot; said the DP. Leaders who accompanied the DP included National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale, Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa (Water and Irrigation), Governor Samuel Tunai (Narok), MPs Paul Bii (Chepalungu) and Korei Lemein (Narok South).&nbsp; Others were Ken Aramat (Narok East), Sopian Tuya (Women Rep, Narok), Aaron Cheruiyot (Kericho) and Emurua Dikirr Jubilee candidate David Keter.

The position is not even in the Constitution,&quot; said Duale. Wamalwa told the Opposition to stop misleading Kenyans that the&nbsp;SGR&nbsp;project was its brainchild. &quot;Opposition leaders failed to deliver when they were in government. They should stop taking credit for Jubilee projects,&quot; he said. And Lemein wondered about numbers, &quot;Support for Jubilee in Narok is almost 100 per cent. I wonder where the Opposition will get 10 million votes to claim victory.&quot;
