&nbsp; Budalang&#39;i MP Ababu Namwamba Budalang&#39;i MP Ababu Namwamba has expressed reservations over the ability of his Funyula counterpart Paul Otuoma to be the county boss. Dr Otuoma is vying for the governorship as an independent candidate after ditching the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) over claims of rigging during the primaries. Mr Namwamba and Otuoma resigned from ODM last year as secretary general and national vice chairman, respectively, citing frustration. Otuoma, however, remained in the party as a member. Namwamba later became the leader of Labour Party of Kenya. Ironically, Namwamba had earlier told his supporters that he supported Otuoma&#39;s bid to lead the county as governor, arguing that the objective was to ensure the incumbent, Sospeter Ojaamong, was defeated.

But on Tuesday, Namwamba appeared to change tune and said his outfit would soon announce its governorship favourite in the August 8 elections. The Budalang&#39;i MP has on several occasions asserted his party supports the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. &quot;Uhuru is going to get overwhelming votes. Whether you like it or not,&quot; he said. [Ignatius Odanga]&nbsp;
