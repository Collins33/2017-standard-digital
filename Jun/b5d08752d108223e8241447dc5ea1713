Kenya has won praise for having the fastest mobile Internet speeds in Africa. The accolade has, however, been blighted by concerns that the cost of connectivity is preventing the majority of Kenyans from enjoying the benefits of faster browsing speeds.

This has catapulted the county ahead of its sub-Saharan Africa peers, including South Africa (6.7Mbps), Morocco (5.2Mbps) and Nigeria (3.9Mbps). Kenya has further been ranked ahead of several developed countries, including Canada, the US and Sweden in terms of mobile Internet connectivity, with the country averaging 13.7 Mbps.
