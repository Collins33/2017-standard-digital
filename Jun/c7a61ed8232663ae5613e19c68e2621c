It&rsquo;s all systems go this weekend as Bamburi Cement starts a training programme for 560 masons in the Coast region. Beneficiaries will be trained on site planning, drawings, setting out and foundations, mix designs, causes of building defects and how to avoid them. They will be also trained on site safety procedures. At the end of the programme they will receive certificates. The seminars in the Coast region will be held in Taita Taveta and Voi today and tomorrow. Similar sessions will be held in Malindi and Bamburi-Island next weekend. The training, which is free, is part of the cement manufacturer&rsquo;s annual skills-bridging programme dubbed Builders Academy, and is being conducted in partnership with the National Construction Authority (NCA). &ldquo;This year, we are reaching out to cement retailers. We will bring in a specialist in retail to help them enhance their entrepreneurial skills and sharpen their business acumen,&rdquo; Susan Maingi, Director Corporate Affairs, Communications and Sustainable Development Bamburi Cement, said.
