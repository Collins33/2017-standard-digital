Governor Wycliffe Oparanya now wants the national government to relinquish its 20 per cent shares in Mumias Sugar Company. He said the Government should release the shares to the county government or fully privatise the miller to save it from collapse. He said private millers in the county, West Kenya and Butali, were making profits yet Mumias was facing financial crisis. &quot;By having 20 per cent shares in the company, it means the national government controls everything regarding the company. This has not worked well in efforts to revive the company,&quot; Mr Oparanya said in an interview. He said the Jubilee government should be pushed to allow the county government have a say in the company. &quot;We have been denied directorship at the company. Our hands are tied and we can do nothing to salvage the factory from collapsing. Private companies are making profits and that is why we want Mumias Sugar Company to be sold to a private investor to handle it,&quot; he said. He said the firm was also being used as a conduit for corruption. &quot;Some powerful people are importing sugar and packing it in Mumias packages.
