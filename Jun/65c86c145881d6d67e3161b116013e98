&nbsp; Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa Sirisia MP John Waluke has said Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa will be Deputy President William Ruto&#39;s running mate in the 2022 elections. Speaking in Eldoret, Mr Waluke said strategies were already in place to ensure Mr Wamalwa&#39;s position was sealed. &quot;We have put all the plans in place to ensure that Jubilee Party wins by a landslide in 2017, and (Uhuru) Kenyatta is a done deal. Our focus is on 2022,&quot; claimed the MP. He said Wamalwa was advised not to vie for the governorship but concentrate on his 2022 bid instead. ALSO READ: Ruto, Duale take vote hunt to Kalonzo turf
