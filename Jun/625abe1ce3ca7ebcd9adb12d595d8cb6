Breast cancer survivors who have undergone mastectomy want a tax waiver on artificial breasts. A single artificial breast costs at least Sh30,000. Speaking at Embu Teaching and Referral Hospital where Mercy Step Foundation donated artificial breasts to survivors, palliative care nurse Niceta Njagi asked the government to waive taxes on the prosthesis. Caroline Munyi, a cancer survivor, said the prosthesis have given her a new lease of life. &ldquo;Now at least people will not stare at me,&rdquo; she said. Njeru Kavuri whose wife benefited from the new breasts said: &ldquo;My wife can now look good in clothes.&rdquo;
