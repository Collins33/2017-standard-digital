Hawkers&nbsp;in Kayole are complaining about &#39;invasion&#39; by foreigners in the informal sector. They say the foreigners, who have no work permits and are mostly from West Africa, are engaging in small businesses. Speaking to Metropolitan, Caleb Okumu, a cake vendor in Kayole&#39;s Kioi area, said they had sought intervention from the local authority since 2015 but no action had ever been taken. Yet their earnings continue to drop. &quot;I used to earn an income of between Sh300 and Sh1,200 a day but since the foreigners came in, raising anything above Sh250 is a miracle,&quot; he said. Documents seen by Metropolitan indicate that Kayole Chief Kennedy Otwere summoned the immigrants to his office after the&nbsp;hawkers&nbsp;complained, but they did not show up and nothing was done. &quot;We have reported the matter to the chief and even to the Member of Parliament, John Ndirangu, but no action was taken. Ndirangu asked us to get their IDs for him to act, which is not something within our reach,&quot; said Mr Okumu. The group of&nbsp;hawkers&nbsp;said the foreigners were now selling milk and pastries, and distributing various snacks to shops for sale.

Gerald Githinji, another&nbsp;hawker, added that the foreigners were providing cheap labour in the region at their expense. &quot;A foreigner now runs milk dispensing machines, barber shops, taxis, electronic and carpentry shops in the area. And they provide their services at a far cheaper price since they do the work for pleasure,&quot; said Mr Githinji. Foreigners boasting The traders said the foreigners were also boasting that they could not be prosecuted. Residents also joined the&nbsp;hawkers&nbsp;to condemn the influx of foreigners, saying even access to water had become a challenge since they (foreigners) moved to the area. &quot;We used to receive water twice a week. Nowadays, we go for months without a drop of water in our taps due to the large number of people living on this side of the city. We need them to be controlled,&quot; said Florence More, a resident.

They want the local authority to step in before things get out of hand. The MP however dissociated himself from the matter, saying he had not received any complaints regarding the invasion of refugees. &quot;Those are lies. I have not received any information regarding foreigners in the area,&quot; he said. [email&#160;protected]
