President Uhuru Kenyatta has appointed Amos SipoiÂ  as the new NGO Coordination Board chairman. The late William Ole Ntimama's son will replace Maj Gen (rtd) Hussein Ali for a period of 3yrs with effect from 1st July 2017. In 2016, President Uhuru appointed Sipoi to chair the Private Security Regulatory Authority, replacing former National Intelligence Service director general Michael Gichangi. Gichangi's appointment was revoked to make way for Sipoi's. Gichangi was appointed on October 2, 2014, after resigning from the NIS following multiple security lapses. Sipoi has not been a prominent figure as his father and has always kept a low profile.
