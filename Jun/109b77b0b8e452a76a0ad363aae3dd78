As the battle for the votes in&nbsp;Western Kenya continues to rage on with Jubilee party stepping up its bid to make inroads in the region, the National Super Alliance (NASA) presidential campaign team has now changed its strategy to keep Jubilee away from the region. The new strategy entails intensive door to door campaigns as well as the use of NASA affiliated party candidates to mobilise their supporters to drum up support for the coalition&#39;s flag bearer Raila Odinga. The team, led by regional coordinator Khalid Njiraini said that they are going to step up their campaigns in the region to ensure that the coalition remains supreme. Njiraini said that the Jubilee was making fruitless efforts&nbsp;adding that all local leaders have vowed to mobilize support for Raila in a region that is set to be one of the major battle grounds ahead of August election. Both Jubilee and NASA have already launched spirited campaigns&nbsp;as they seek to outdo each other in a popularity contest. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday visited Funyula, Bumala and Nambale in Western region.
