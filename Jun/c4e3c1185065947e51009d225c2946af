High Court has quashed decision by Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) dispute resolution committee to block Wavinya Ndeti from contesting for Machakos governorship. The committee had defended its decision to bar Wavinya Ndeti from vying arguing that she employed political mischief, which was hatched by the Wiper Party to circumvent party resignation laws, as she did not qualify to contest under the party. Wavinya insisted that she had followed the law, and ensured she was in Wiper Party&#39;s list before the deadline set by IEBC, which is the main point of argument at the High Court. Lawyer Paul Nyamondi, for the commission, told Justice George Odunga that the aspirant based her membership to Wiper through a coalition agreement with Chama cha Uzalendo (CCU) dated April 24 this year. High Court has however ruled that she is eligible to run for Machakos governor seat on Wiper Party ticket. ALSO READ: Governor Lusaka to face IEBC over election chaos
