A local mobile phone-based application has been awarded the 2017 Financial Times/IFC Transformational Business Award in Sustainable Development. M-Tiba, developed by CarePay, PharmAccess Foundation and Safaricom, enables users to save, send, receive and pay money for medical treatment through a mobile health wallet on their phones. The scheme also allows users to save funds on their wallet for use at accredited health facilities.
