The county government and a former diplomat have renewed their quarrel about the operations of an Australian mining firm in the county. The county government has refuted claims that it was involved in the renewal of a special mining licence for Base Titanium in the region. In a statement, the county government instead said it has since 2015 put pressure on the mining company to stop its expansion plans to prevent tensions among the residents. &quot;Any allegations insinuating that the county government of Kwale consented and/or authorised exploration by Base Titanium for mining are not only inaccurate but also misplaced, ill conceived, and at best a figment of the proponent&#39;s imagination,&quot; said the statement. Chirau Ali Mwakwere, a former high commissioner to Tanzania, has made alleged land grabbing by top Jubilee politicians and expropriation of local minerals the cornerstone of his campaign for the governor&#39;s seat. He claimed that Governor Salim Mvurya has failed to prevent the alleged grabbing, a claim the governor has denied. Local activists have also accused the county administration of concluding with Base Titanium to have the mining zone extended without consulting the area&#39;s residents. &nbsp;
