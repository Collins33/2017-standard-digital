A man who was sentenced to two months in jail for stealing a&nbsp;cabbage&nbsp;worth Sh40 from a mission hospital was released on Tuesday. Robert Kihara, who pleaded guilty to the charge of theft, was sentenced to two months imprisonment after he failed to raise a fine of Sh10,000. Cabbage&nbsp;dinner Kihara was found stealing from the Mercy Mission Hospital vegetable garden by security guards on June 21 and arraigned in court on June 22. He pleaded guilty to the charges before Senior Resident Magistrate Rhoda Yator and told the court he had planned to cook the&nbsp;cabbage&nbsp;for dinner. The court gave him two options: a Sh10,000 fine or two months imprisonment. Kihara failed to pay the fine and the magistrate sent him to jail, where he stayed for a week before well-wishers bailed him out.

They drove me to the police station,&quot; he said. Kihara said he thought his brother, Francis Mugo, who is in charge of the mission hospital, would come to his rescue, but the priest neither called nor visited him in the cells. Kihara, who says it was his first time to be held in a police cell, said he tried to convince the police to release him, in vain, &quot;Cells were not friendly. I was ordered to remove my shoes and hand over mobile phone. The police warned me against arguing with them while in the cell. I had to comply,&quot; said Kihara. On June 2, he said he cried before the court after he was sent to prison, pleading for leniency. &quot;I was worried about my fate because of the &#39;bad&#39; stories I have heard from inmates about what happens in prison,&quot; he said.

Invaluable lesson &quot;Prison has taught me to respect other people&#39;s belongings,&quot; said Kihara. Prison warders said he was a disciplined inmate and obeyed orders promptly and without protest. &quot;Kihara has been here a few days but he has been obedient. We are happy to see him leave and join his family,&quot; said an officer who requested anonymity because he is not authorised to speak for the prison. Bemih Kanyonge, an advocate who led a team of well-wishers to bail out Kihara, said the public should be sensitised on alternative ways of seeking justice for petty crimes.
