City gubernatorial candidate Mike Sonko has called on Peter Kenneth to join the Jubilee&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;team. Sonko said he was willing to work with Kenneth in building Nairobi County. &ldquo;There is no permanent enmity in politics, we need to forgive each other and work together. There are so many slots in Nairobi and we can even negotiate for him a Cabinet position,&rdquo; said Sonko. He added: &ldquo;I have no hard feelings, let us unite and take Nairobi to the next level,&rdquo; Sonko said. Kenneth was defeated by Sonko in the party primaries held in April. He rejected the outcome of the nomination and is currently running for the seat as an independent candidate.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Disunity threatens NASA Nairobi Team
