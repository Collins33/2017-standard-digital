The MPs, who included Fafi&#39;s Barre Shill, said they would be compelled to purchase guns from Somalia to protect the people. Mr Shill, who spoke in Nairobi yesterday, asked the Government to recruit Kenyan Police Reservists (KPR). &quot;If the State does not act, we will be forced to mobilise our people and purchase guns from Somalia so that we can protect ourselves,&quot; said Shill. Others at the press briefing were Shukran Gure (Garissa), Mohamed Duale (Dadaab), Mohammed Shidiye (Lagdera) and Ibrahim Abba.
