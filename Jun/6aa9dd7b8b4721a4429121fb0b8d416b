The party&#39;s National Election Board chair, Judith Pareno has also been found in contempt of court for disobeying a court order.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She explained why she should not be committed to civil jail for elections board for failing to obey a court order directing her to tabulate the nomination results for Muhoroni Constituency&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The court then directed Pareno to ensure that results were tabulated and winner be declared using the total tally, an order which the party chose to ignore. Justice Lesiit accused Pareno of trying to evade a court order. Pareno has been asked by the court to show cause why she should not be committed to civil jail.
