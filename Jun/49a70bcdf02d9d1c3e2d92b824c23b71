Governor Peter Munya has petitioned the managers of Isiolo Airport to provide space for miraa and other agricultural produce. &quot;My administration has petitioned the airport to provide that space because the facility was built to reduce road accidents and congestion caused by miraa vehicles,&quot; Mr Munya said on Wednesday. &quot;About 80 per cent of the airport, constructed majorly to facilitate the transportation of miraa, is in Meru. That is why they need to give our farmers some space at the facility.&quot; The governor wants the airport managers to explain how it has allocated space for different agricultural produce. &quot;The airport was also built to decongest Wilson Airport in Nairobi. I will be in Isiolo next week to follow up the matter,&quot; said Munya. Meanwhile the governor blamed a number of local leaders of failing to agitate for development.
