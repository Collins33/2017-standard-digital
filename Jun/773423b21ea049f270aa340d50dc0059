Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua has officially withdrawn his candidature for the governor seat. He wrote a letter to IEBC dated June 3, 2017 confirming that he had pulled out of the race. Mr. Mbugua says he will support Jubilee Party candidate Lee Kinyanjui for Nakuru Governor. Governor Mbugua had earlier decided to seek a second term as an independent candidate after losing the Jubilee primaries to former Nakuru town MP Lee Kinyanjui. He had described the Jubilee Party nominations as a sham, saying the exercise was marred with malpractices that the election board ignored. He later agreed to leave the race with political arch rival Lee Kinyanjui after lengthy negotiations with President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto at State House Nakuru.&nbsp;
