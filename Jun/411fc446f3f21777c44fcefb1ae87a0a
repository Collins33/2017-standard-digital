Kitui Governor Julius Malombe has pledged to rally the residents behind Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and deliver the county&#39;s votes as a bloc to the National Super Alliance (NASA) in the August 8 General Election. Malombe urged the residents to be wary of Jubilee moles who were hiding behind Independent tickets and others in parties that were not affiliated to NASA but purport to associate with Kalonzo. &quot;It is now an open secret. Mr Odinga would be a one-term President and handover the leadership mantle to Kalonzo in 2022. This is an opportune moment for Kambas which cannot be squandered,&quot; the Governor said. He spoke on Friday in Kanyangi ward, Kitui Rural constituency, during an inspection tour of development projects initiated by his government since 2013. Malombe said in 2022, Kenya will sing in one voice of unity under Kalonzo&#39;s leadership and urged the community to reject Jubilee in total even for the smallest seat, claiming that the community has been shortchanged by the collapsing Jubilee government. The Governor reiterated that he is ready to face his challenger, Senator David Musila, for the second time.

I will do the same in August where I am prepared to send him to permanent political retirement,&quot; he said. He also tore into his other challenger, former Cabinet Secretary Charity Ngilu, saying she made a wrong move to vie for governor&#39;s seat while her tainted past continued to haunt her reputation and career. Addressing stop-over rallies at Kavoo, Kalulini, Masimba, Kithiani, Kiseuni, Kanyongonyo, Nzambia and Kanyangi trading centres, the Governor appealed to county residents to give him another term in office.
