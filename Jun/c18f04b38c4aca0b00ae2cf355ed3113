Former anti-drug agency chairman John Mututho has lashed out at Opposition leader Raila Odinga over his proposal to legalise chang&#39;aa if elected President. Mr Mututho termed the statement as reckless, noting that the country is already reeling from the effects of alcohol consumption. Mututho, the former National Authority for the Campaign against Alcohol and Drug Abuse chairman, said the country has over six million liquor addicts, majority of whom are college students. While on a tour of Western Kenya, the NASA leader promised to legalise brewing of chang&#39;aa as one way of supporting the local industry. Deputy President William Ruto has dismissed Raila&#39;s sentiment, arguing that the number of youths consuming alcohol is worrying. Mututho added that there is urgent need to set more rehabilitation centres in the country. The Nakuru gubernatorial aspirant termed alcohol as one of the major problems facing youths in the country.
