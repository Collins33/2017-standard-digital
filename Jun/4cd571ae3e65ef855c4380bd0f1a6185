A Kenya Agricultural Livestock and Research Organisation (Kalro) official has called on county governments to fund research initiatives. Kalro Embu Director Patrick Gicheru said the organisation with assistance from the devolved units would be able to carry out more research to benefit farmers in their localities. He said the organisation on its own might not manage to do much research due to limited funding. Dr Gicheru asked the county governments to adopt the research work done by Kalro and apply it to solve the problems faced by farmers in particular areas. &quot;Agriculture is now devolved and we are seeking to work closely with county governments. We are asking counties to partner with us in some of our work so that new research findings can reach the farmers,&quot; he said. Gicheru cited a recent research into the drying up of miraa in parts of Meru found that the crops were infested with scales (aonidiella ssp).

The farmers were advised to use pesticides with active ingredient azadirachtin, which is based on Neem seed kernel to contain scales. &nbsp;
