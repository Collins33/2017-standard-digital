Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) declines to clear Nairobi Governor aspirant Miguna Miguna after he presented 2,000 signatures in Jpeg format instead of Excel as required by IEBC. He is contesting for Nairobi seat as an Independent candidate. The Commission gave Miguna until tomorrow to present his papers in the right format so as to get cleared.
