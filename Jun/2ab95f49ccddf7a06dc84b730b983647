High Court directs Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to include Wiper Party nominee for Machakos governorship Wavinya Ndeti&rsquo;s name on the ballot paper while pending appeal. On Thursday, IEBC had declared Wavinya&rsquo;s nomination by Wiper Party irregular and barred her from contesting for Machakos governorship. The Commission&rsquo;s Dispute Resolution Tribunal annulled her certificate on grounds that she was also a member of Chama Cha Uzalendo (CCU). &quot;At the time of the nomination of Ndeti, she was a member of both Chama Cha Uzalendo and Wiper party, which is against the law,&quot; said the panel. The ruling followed a successful petition by MCA Peter Kyalo. The petitioner, a member of Wiper, argued that Ndeti should be disqualified from the race. Ndeti had filed appeal at High Court challenging IEBC&rsquo;s decision to nullify her nomination as Wiper candidate in Machakos governor race.
