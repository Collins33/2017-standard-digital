&nbsp; Two Kenyans have been elected to sit in the powerful Governing Body, the executive body of the International Labour Organisation, at the ongoing ILO Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Central Organisation of Trade Unions Secretary General Francis Atwoli and Federation of Kenyan Employers chief executive Jacqueline Mugo have been elected as members of the crucial arm of ILO. Atwoli&#39;s re-election means this is the fourth term he will be sitting in the Governing Body while this is Mugo&#39;s debut appearance. The two will be key in making decisions on policy, agenda of the International Labour Conference, adopting the draft programme and budgeting of the ILO for submission to the conference. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Crack the whip on cartels, Atwoli tells Uhuru
