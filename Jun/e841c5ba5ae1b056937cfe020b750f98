A school has sent home 12 students for allegedly refusing to shave their hair. The Rangenyo Girls High School students were seen at Nyamira bus terminus stranded with their boxes, mattresses and other belongings, attracting the attention of the curious public. Concerned, the public led by the town&#39;s boda boda riders escorted the girls back to school, which is about two kilometres from the town, demanding an explanation from the school principal on why the girls were out on a school day. However, they did not get audience with the principal, Lydiah Onyoni, who locked the school&#39;s main gate. There was tension around the school for the better part of yesterday morning as the riders demanded the immediate transfer of the principal over what they termed high-handedness on the girls. The girls were, however, returned to the school after Nyamira South sub-county education officer Isaac Ombati intervened.

The students were being served with only one shaving machine, something some of the learners opposed, according to the source. The principal could not be reached for comment.
