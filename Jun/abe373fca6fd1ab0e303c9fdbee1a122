The initial phase of the construction of&nbsp;Konza&nbsp;Technology City will cost a whopping Sh200 billion, the Government has announced. The Vision 2030 project is expected to generate about 17,000 direct high-value jobs, and a further 68,000 indirect jobs once completed. Victor Kyalo, the Principal Secretary in charge of ICT and Innovation at the Ministry of ICT, said basic infrastructure and other crucial&nbsp;city amenities have already been laid. Speaking on the sidelines of Mid-Term Review of the third medium term plan of Kenya Vision 2030 in Machakos, the PS revealed that the Government had signed a deal with South Korea to set up an institute that will oversee construction works in&nbsp;Konza. He said Phase One of the construction is expected to be completed by 2022.&nbsp;&quot;In the next one month, Kenya Advanced Institute of Technology modeled against the Korea Advanced Institute of Technology will start construction works in&nbsp;Konza,&quot; said Kyalo.
