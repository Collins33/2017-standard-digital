Local Jubilee Party leaders want their rivals to steer clear of President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s visit to the region. Senator Kiraitu Murungi, who is hoping to unseat Governor Peter Munya in the polls, said non-Jubilee aspirants should stay away from the meetings unless they wore the party&#39;s colours. Meanwhile, Kiraitu who was flanked by Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi and parliamentary candidates Shadrack Mwiti (South Imenti) and Maore Maoka (Igembe Central), said the President would launch development projects, including new roads, in the constituencies.
