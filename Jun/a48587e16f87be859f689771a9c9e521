The Senate has summoned Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero to shed more light on a Sh72 billion debt owed to the county by the national government. The Senate Committee on Budget and Finance Monday summoned the governor to appear before it on Thursday, June 8 after it received a petition from the county seeking help in recovering the billions that had accrued over time. The summons was made through a letter dated May 30 and signed by Jeremiah Nyegenye, Clerk of the Senate. &quot;The committee is in receipt of your petition concerning debts owed to the Nairobi city county by the national government and its agencies... This is to invite you to come and present the issues concerning the settlement of debt and any other relevant issues to the committee,&quot; read the letter. Mr Nyegenye, through the letter, directed that the said evidence be forwarded to the committee on or before June 5 to enable it familiarise itself with the documentation before the date of the meeting. Governor Kidero said the debt from parking fees and land rates had over the years accrued huge interest and penalties. The city chief said failure by the national government to remit the funds was to blame for poor service delivery. He will appear before the Senate at 10am.&nbsp; ALSO READ: You have nothing on me, Kidero tells off EACC
