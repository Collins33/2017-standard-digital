The government will spend Sh15 million on the reconstruction of Sikubale bridge, which connects Kakamega and Bungoma counties. Work has started, according to&nbsp;Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe when he officially launched the construction at the weekend. A lorry that was transporting molasses plunged into the river when the bridge collapsed earlier this year. Four people were killed. &quot;The government is committed to completing the bridge in the shortest time possible. &quot;Our people have been suffering since the bridge collapsed and that is why I want to appreciate the Government for this kind gesture. I also want to assure our people the bridge will be ready for use soon,&quot; Wangwe said The bridge is vital to the economies of the two counties as it facilitates trade between them. Children have also found it difficult to cross the river to go to and from school after the bridge collapsed. ALSO READ: NASA membership :ANC wants monopoly of Vihiga &nbsp;
