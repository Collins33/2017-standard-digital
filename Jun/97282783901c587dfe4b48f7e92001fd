MUMIAS, KENYA: The controversy surrounding Mumias Sugar Company has returned to haunt the Opposition leaders.&nbsp; Jubilee leaders in the region are now demanding that NASA chief Raila Odinga should pay &lsquo;debt&rsquo; he owes the company for molasses his company got from Mumias.&nbsp; &quot;NASA leaders are to blame for the financial woes affecting Mumias. Raila should be made aware that he owes the company some money and he should pay it,&quot; said Rashid Mohammed, former ODM national youth leader. &quot;Some leaders hiding in Opposition as financiers contributed to the financial woes affecting Mumias Sugar Company. The Opposition should tell the community why they have kept silent when the company was collapsing.&quot; He asked the Opposition leaders not to implicate Jubilee leaders in sugar politics yet NASA leaders looted from the company. He said Jubilee government has promised to revive the sugar miller claiming that some of NASA advisors swindled the Sh3.1 billion allocated to the company as bailout.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Stop conspiracy theories on Ronald Lubya's death He noted that the government has accepted their proposal to allocate Sh3.6 billion additional funds to the company.&nbsp; Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya dismissed claims that NASA leaders &#39;killed&#39; the company saying Jubilee has failed to revive the sugar miller. &quot;Jubilee is playing a PR exercise using the company to hoodwink the community. It is the same government which is almost killing sugar industries in the region,&quot; said Oparanya. &quot;The Sh 3.2 billion bailout for the company is a drop in the ocean, the company needs at least Sh 12 billion,&quot; he said.
