State agencies appear to have thrown in the towel in the quest to block political candidates with questionable integrity. Instead, they now want the electorate to weed out leaders who do not meet Chapter Six of the Constitution at the ballot come August 8. Speaking at the National Elections Conference that ended Wednesday, heads of various independent institutions cited legal frustrations as well as the &lsquo;culture of our person&rsquo; by Kenyans as some of the reasons it was unattainable to block politicians seeking elective seats. Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Keriako Tobiko accused Kenyans of electing corrupt leaders only to turn back and blame State agencies for not barring them. Political noise &ldquo;Do we really, as voters, pay regard to integrity? Why do we vote those facing charges then turn around to blame State agencies,&rdquo; posed Mr Tobiko.
