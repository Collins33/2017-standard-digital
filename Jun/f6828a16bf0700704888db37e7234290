President Uhuru Kenyatta continued with his charm offensive in western Kenya on Sunday. Uhuru attended a church service in&nbsp;Vihiga&nbsp;County and later commissioned projects worth Sh2.5 billion. Uhuru&rsquo;s visit came a day after the National Super Alliance (NASA) pitched tent in the area, campaigning in the five sub-counties before holding a major rally in Mbale on Saturday. This was the President&rsquo;s fourth visit in the past three weeks as Jubilee intensified its hunt for the region&rsquo;s estimated 1.4 million votes. More projects Among the projects commissioned was the Sh1.8 billion&nbsp;Vihiga&nbsp;water supply and Sh200 million business complex at Kaimosi Friends University College, a constituent college of Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology.
