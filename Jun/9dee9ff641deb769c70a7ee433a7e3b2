Amid the blockade by Gulf Arab neighbours, Qatar is slowly entering into a crisis situation. In an attempt to solve the supply-demand woes over milk, a local businessman is working on plans to airlift 4,000 Holstein dairy cows into the country. The proposal, which is being described as the biggest airlift of cattle ever attempted, comes as Qatar is trying to open an air and sea bridge via Iran, Turkey and port facilities in Oman, reports The Guardian. Moutaz Al Khayyat, chairman of Power International Holding told about his incredible plan first to the Bloomberg news agency, stating that it would take as many as 60 flights to deliver the cattle, which were bought in australia and the US. The businessman had originally planned to import the cows by ship for a newly completed dairy facility near doha. Saudi Arabia, bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have cut off diplomatic, economic and transport ties with Qatar since June 5th, accusing Doha of supporting extremist groups.
