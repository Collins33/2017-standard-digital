Deputy President William Ruto has dismissed the National Super Alliance&#39;s (NASA) touted win of 10 million votes in the August elections as a pipe&nbsp;dream. Mr Ruto said the regions that were formerly NASA strongholds in the 2013 General Election had seen their leaders and supporters decamp to Jubilee Party. While steering clear of local leaders&#39; urging to denounce independent candidates, the DP said he and President Uhuru Kenyatta would work with leaders elected by the people. The DP said the Opposition would suffer a resounding defeat compared to the last election. &ldquo;The Jubilee government has done a lot to alleviate the socio-economic status of Kenyans and we believe we will be re-elected on that basis,&rdquo; said Ruto. He accused the Opposition of copying parts of the Jubilee manifesto, including the section on free secondary school education.

Ruto, who arrived in the area after touring Kakamega County, was accompanied by Jubilee leaders from Western and North Rift regions. Labour Party of Kenya leader Ababu Namwanba said the perceived NASA strongholds were now championing Jubilee&#39;s re-election. During the rally in Nandi, Jubilee candidates said they would campaign against all their rivals, including independent candidates.
