Kanu aspirants in Kericho have castigated their Jubilee counterparts for launching personal attacks on the independence party leader Gideon Moi. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, Nandi Senator Stephen Sang and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi at the weekend lashed out at the Baringo senator for challenging Deputy President William Ruto as the Rift Valley political kingpin. But on Tuesday, the Kanu team led by Belgut parliamentary aspirant Raymond Cheruiyot and Londiani ward candidate Ben Siele told off Mandago, Sang and Sudi for attempting to kill democracy in Rift Valley. &quot;The Rift Valley Jubilee aspirants are not more equal than others. We stand shoulder to shoulder with them. They should therefore not try to dictate how area residents should vote,&quot; said Cheruiyot. The Kanu team spoke as independent candidates led by MPs Benjamin Langat (Ainamoi), Erick Keter (Belgut), and Wilson Soi who is eyeing the Soin/Sigowet parliamentary seat declared war on their Jubilee rivals. &quot;The Jubilee Party primaries was not the General Election. The real deal is the August 8 polls,&quot; said Langat. ALSO READ: When ruling a country sometimes goes horribly wrong
