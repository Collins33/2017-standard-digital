NAIROBI, KENYA: City hall has halted plans to hire some 600 inspectorate officers after &#39;cartels&#39; allegedly infiltrated the process. The city government has postponed the exercise now for the third time without giving clear reasons for the same. On Sunday, Nairobi Governor Evans kidero said that brokers had held the exercise hostage and were trying to rig in their family members. &quot;We had to cancel the entire exercise because there are some brokers who are trying to discriminate the applicants and instead hire their family members,&quot; said kidero. He was addressing residents of Viwandani after a church service at the AIC viwandani church. Last week, thousands of job seekers turned rowdy on Monday after a recruitment exercise at Nairobi&#39;s City Inspectorate Training School in Dagoretti was postponed for the third time without notice. The applicants were angered by the move saying that there was no clear communication on whether the exercise had been cancelled.

Some even took it a step further and hurled stones at motorists. The jilted applicants were seeking to be hired as county constables. &nbsp;
