The Orange party has threatened to sack party officials supporting independent candidates ahead of the August 8 elections. Homa Bay County chairperson Gladys Wanga, Governor Cyprian Awiti and Senator Moses Kajwang&#39; expressed concern that a number of officials were going against the &#39;six-piece suit&#39; voting pattern the party was pushing for. In a meeting at Mr Awiti&#39;s home on Tuesday, the politicians accused the officials of negating the party ideology of supporting its own candidates. Ms Wanga said ODM rebels would no longer be allowed to hold their offices. &quot;All ODM officials should preach the party ideology. Those going against this cease to be members and must quit their positions,&quot; she said. ALSO READ: Pro-Raila campaign team hits at independent candidates
