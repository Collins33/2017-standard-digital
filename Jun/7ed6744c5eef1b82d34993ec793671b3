ELDORET, KENYA: Kerio Valley residents have termed as inadequate Sh1 billion compensation offer announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta during his recent campaign visit in the region. &quot;I have directed the Ministry of Mining officials led by Cabinet Secretary for Mining, Dan Kazungu, to visit the area and address the longstanding issue,&quot; said the Head of State while on a campaign rally at Chepkorio in Keiyo South constituency recently. But the residents have termed the package dismal and demand Sh9 billion to be disbursed to the residents who have endured misery for over four decades even as the mining Cabinet Secretary is set to visit Kerio Valley and expedite the compensation exercise. The money is to cater for the over 20, 000 families displaced by the Kenya Flourspar mining company after they donated their land and they are expected to receive the funds before the end of this month. According to Micah Kigen, the community representative, a government task force which was investigating the atrocities meted on the locals had recommended Sh1 million per acre as compensation.
