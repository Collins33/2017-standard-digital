Players in the flower industry have been asked to familiarise themselves with export requirements even as they wait to benefit from direct flights to US. The flights are scheduled to begin in April next year. Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service Managing Director Esther Kimani said preparedness would help avoid interceptions or rejections at border points. &ldquo;I urge all here present to familiarise themselves with the requirements of the USA Plant Import Permit and phytosanitary certificates,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Dr Kimani. &nbsp;
