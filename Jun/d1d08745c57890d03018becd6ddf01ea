A section of independent candidates from South Nyanza have hit back at Oburu Oginga over remarks that they are being funded by Jubilee. The aspirants read Dr Oburu the riot act, telling him he was too senior to engage in propaganda politics. Led by Migori gubernatorial candidate Ochillo Ayako, the aspirants said Oburu was a respected and seasoned politician who should not soil his political resume by engaging in unfounded propaganda. The former minister said the nominated MP and other politicians preaching &#39;six-piece-suit&#39; voting pattern had the right to do so, but should engage in agenda-based politics rather than vilifying independent candidates. &quot;Independent candidates already have a place in the Kenyan politics and they cannot be wished away based on cheap propaganda,&quot; said Mr Ayacko, adding &quot;politicians and political parties should compete on agenda&quot;. Homa Bay governor aspirant Oyugi Magwanga faulted the Oburu-led team campaigning for Raila Odinga for labelling them Jubilee sympathisers. He accused unpopular candidates in the region of hiding behind the &#39;six-piece&#39; voting pattern instead of telling the electorate their development agenda.
