Kisii, Kwale, Kilifi and Murang&#39;a are the leading counties in the abuse of elderly members of society. National Gender and Equality Commission Chief Executive Officer Paul Kuria said the number of elderly people being abused or discriminated against was on the rise in the four counties. Speaking at a ceremony to mark the International Day for the Elderly in Kisii town on Thursday, Mr Kuria said it was disturbing that elderly people in the four counties were being mistreated by the people who were supposed to protect them. &quot;We have very many cases of elderly people experiencing psychological torture, financial exploitation, material exploitation and rape,&quot; he said. Commission vice chairperson Simon Ndubai assured Kenyans that from January 2018, all people aged 70 years and above would start receiving a monthly stipend of Sh2,000 from the Government for their basic needs. Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi said many cases where the elderly were killed in the name of witchcraft were executed by people who wanted to grab their property.
