Rescue teams were deployed to search for missing people after a seven-storey building collapsed at Mukuru Kwa Njenga in Embakasi, Nairobi Monday night. Most of the tenants had been evacuated before it caved in on Monday night. Nairobi police boss Japheth Koome said they had taken a roll call of the occupants. &ldquo;The residents say between two to ten or more people are missing. There could be some who refused to leave when they were being told to evacuate but we are doing our best to establish the claims,&rdquo; said Koome. Several emergency service providers were sent to the scene hours later to help in digging through the rubble. St John Ambulance said that 15 people were still missing by Tuesday morning. Officials leading the operation said it would take long to dig through the rubble to confirm the claims. The owner of the building could not be immediately traced. The seven-floor building had been condemned after a number of cracks opened up on its walls and some tenants had since vacated. Several houses have collapsed in Nairobi in the recent past, claiming many lives. Officials have been threatening to tame those behind the construction of the structures but no action has been forthcoming.&nbsp;
