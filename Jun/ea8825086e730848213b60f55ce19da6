The implementation of a plan to insert microchips with ownership details on the windscreen of motor vehicles has been long in coming. Not only will this microchip provide a history and accident records of vehicles that can be picked by roadside scanners, it will also significantly reduce thefts and carjackings. The National Transport and Safety Authority should draw up an elaborate implementation programme to ensure that all vehicles are fitted with microchips embedded in tamper-proof windscreen stickers. With this system in place, the gathering and storage of data will be automated. For instance, the jumping of traffic lights will be picked by roadside scanners and a fine will be posted to the offending party without the intervention of a traffic policeman. This will reduce opportunities to issue or solicit for bribes. And because of this, the NTSA plan will most certainly meet some resistance. The NTSA must not waiver in its attempts to bring order to our roads. For far too long, crooks have been able to fool detectives by switching number plates after car thefts. Regrettably drivers with long accident records have been able to renew their operating licences even though they pose a danger to other road users. It is expected that with these data chips, the inefficient and cumbersome paper filing of accident records will be minimised. As this data will be contained in the chips, it is envisaged that the retrieval of vehicle records and driver information will be easier. Ultimately road safety will be greatly enhanced.
