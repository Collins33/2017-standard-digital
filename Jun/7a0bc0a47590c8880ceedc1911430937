Ranchers and conservationists have hit out at Opposition leader Raila Odinga for suggesting largely white-owned ranches in the county should be dismantled. Raila was quoted by The Times of London on Monday saying he would dismantle the ranches in Laikipia and northern Kenya if he won in the August 8 elections. He laid the blame for the violent land invasions in recent months, in which several people have been killed and tourist lodges and homes destroyed, on the ranchers and the Government&#39;s failure to manage them better. &quot;These ranches are too big and the people don&#39;t even live there. They live in Europe and only come once in a while. There&#39;s a need for rationalisation to ensure that there is more productive use of that land,&quot; Raila told The Times. Yesterday, the Laikipia Farmers&#39; Association (LFA), which brings together farmers, ranchers and conservationists in the county, said they were unhappy with Raila&#39;s remarks. In a statement, LFA said its members contributed Sh10 billion county&#39;s economy between 2014 and 2016.

Raila, through his spokesperson Dennis Onyango, sought to clear the air. &quot;Ending the antagonistic relationship between pastoralists and ranchers and giving protection to each of the groups under the law constitute Mr Odinga&#39;s position on the situation in Laikipia. Mr Odinga believes ranchers and pastoralists must be helped to co-exist and that the firm and fair hand of the State is the missing link. Mr Odinga promises to provide this once elected as president in the August elections,&quot; Mr Onyango said.

In a media statement dated February 12, 2017, Mr Odinga called on the Government to deploy agricultural extension officers to work with the ranchers and herders,&quot; he added. In March, herders killed rancher Tristan Voorspuy on the 24,000-acre Sosian Ranch before attacking conservationist Kuki Gallmann in the ensuing conflicts in April.
