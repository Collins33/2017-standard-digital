Nurses to miss pay over strike. Nurses on strike will not be paid for the days they miss work. Health Chief Officer Ojwang Lusi, who insisted the strike was illegal, said he had asked them to return to work but they refused. &quot;We have been taking roll call and no one will be paid for the days they failed to report to work,&quot; he said. Nurses&#39; union official Collins Ajwang termed the remarks mere intimidation.
