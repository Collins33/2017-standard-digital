Uber has announced the launch of a new&nbsp;intelligent safety features technology that will ensure the safety of its drivers and riders in all Uber-operated regions in the country. The technology known as Real-Time ID, which uses the app, will check the safety of drivers and passengers at the start of the journey. The new feature allows the driver to periodically share selfies with Uber before going online. Uber will then compare the photo to the one corresponding to the account on file to verify the driver&#39;s details before the car is driven.
