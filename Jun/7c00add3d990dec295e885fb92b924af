A member of ODM has petitioned the electoral agency to bar nominated MP Elizabeth Ongoro from contesting the Ruaraka parliamentary seat. The petitioner argues Ms Ongoro defected from ODM to Amani National Congress after the legal deadline for switching parties. In a letter signed by the party&rsquo;s secretary general, ODM claims Ongoro resigned way after the deadline and was, therefore, not eligible to vie on any other party. The move signals sibling rivalry that is simmering among parties allied to the National Super Alliance (NASA). No merit In the letter, an ODM member Fredrick Odhiambo Ayieko claims Ongoro should not be allowed to vie for the Ruaraka seat on ANC. Ms Ongoro defected to NASA principal Musalia Mudavadi&rsquo;s party in April, a day after ODM blocked her from contesting the Ruaraka seat, accusing the nominated senator of instigating electoral violence during the campaigns ahead of the party primaries in April. Thursday, ANC secretary general Godfrey Osotsi dismissed the case, claiming it did not have any substance and they would respond on the matter in due course. This is not the first tiff between ODM and ANC. In April, Mr Osotsi and ODM secretary general and nominated senator Agnes Zani had bitter exchanges over a leaked strategy document on the selection of the coalition&rsquo;s flag bearer.
