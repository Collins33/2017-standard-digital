A new maize seed variety has been introduced in Kenya, which experts say would shield the country from perennial food shortages in the long-run. Known as WE1101, the new variety is not only drought tolerant but also high-producing and can resist lethal attacks from pests and diseases. Now in its third planting season in Kenya, WE1101 takes three months to mature, making it ideal for Western, Rift Valley, Nyanza and Central regions where rainfall patterns have &ldquo;drastically&rdquo; changed. Producing an average of 33 bags an acre, the variety is also ideal in some parts of Coast, Eastern and North Eastern. &ldquo;Due to the fact that it matures fast, the maize variety escapes the attack from different diseases and pests. It is therefore a maize variety that fits perfectly with the needs of our farmers, particularly the small-scale ones who are the majority in Kenya,&rdquo; says Shem Odhiambo, the Country Director of Export Trading Group, a Nairobi-based farm inputs multinational that is behind the new maize variety. Mr Odhiambo says in the long-run, the new crop variety will bridge the gap that exists between the maize market demand and supply. To ensure that even small-scale farmers benefit from it, the Country Director says the maize seeds are packaged to as small as two-kilogramme packets.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are not just selling this maize variety at affordable rates, we are going even further to offering free extension services to farmers across the country. Our primary aim is to help Kenya be food stable.&rdquo; Mr Odhiambo says farmers seeking to purchase the seed variety can get them from farm inputs distributors in major towns across the country.&nbsp;
