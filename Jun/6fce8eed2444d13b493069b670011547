The document was suspended by President Mwai Kibaki during his tenure to allow nationals from Rwanda and Uganda to work without paying fees. Kenya joins Tanzania, which has maintained work permit requirements for its regional neighbours. Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli cautioned that the move will derail free movement of labour as envisaged under the Common Market Protocol. &ldquo;The decision by the Kenya Government to introduce work permit requirements for all foreigners from East Africa Community countries and outside the region as well as issue deterrent legal measures to those found engaging aliens without requisite documents is a huge blow to the region&rsquo;s integration process, particularly to the Common Market Protocol,&rdquo; he said.

Personal differences &ldquo;If these politicians have their own personal differences owing to their individual interests and egoism, which do not conform with the need and aspirations of the people of East Africa, it shouldn&rsquo;t drive our nation into slamming visas to Tanzanians who are entering Kenya or vice versa because most of these movements are for business purposes,&rdquo; he said.
