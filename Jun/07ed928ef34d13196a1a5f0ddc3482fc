Safaricom has launched a mobile and web-based service targeting farmers. Connected Farmer will help agricultural processing businesses connect with farmers by leveraging M-Pesa to make and receive payments securely. It will also help register and key in information such as expected production quantities, helping processors plan, especially on their work force, resulting in overall reduction in production costs. &ldquo;Our aim is to digitise the end-to-end operations of agricultural produce processing firms creating supply chain efficiencies, linking farmers to commercial markets while facilitating productivity improvements,&rdquo; said Director of Enterprise Business Rita Okuthe. The service is a partnership between Safaricom and Mezzanine Ware &ndash; a firm that specialises in mobile-enabled solutions for businesses.
