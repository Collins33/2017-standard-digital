The University Academic Staff Union (UASU) has called a National Executive Council meeting to discuss a Sh10 billion pay deal. The UASU boss Constantine Wasonga on Monday said the union would not back down or accept anything short of the inked deal. The Government has offered a Sh4.7 billion pay package, promising to pay the rest in future phases, something that the dons are opposed to. &quot;We will not accept anything short of the deal,&quot; said Wasonga. He said they would not accept to have the Government treat them to &quot;ping-pong games&quot; and that they were waiting to see what would be sent to their account as at the end of June 30 before they act. &quot;Once we get the pay, we will make a formal announcement,&quot; declared Wasonga.

The Government signed the deal with UASU, the Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational Institutions, Hospitals and Allied Workers (Kudheiha) and the Kenya University Staff Union (KUSU), which ended a 54-day strike on March 13. Under the deal, workers in all public universities would get a pay rise starting July 1. KUSU Secretary General Charles Mukhwaya said the unions did not negotiate for a phased payment plan. &quot;The line ministry and Treasury are working out payments, which must be done on or before June 30,&quot; said Mukhwaya.
