A Chinese businessman lost Sh2 million he had withdrawn from a bank to pay his workers in Kilimani. The businessman told police he had withdrawn the money on Sunday morning from a bank and took the same to his house for safekeeping. He kept it in a safe in his bedroom on the fifth floor of an apartment before he left to run his errands. When he came back at about 9pm, he found the house broken into and ransacked, with the money and other valuables missing. Nairobi police boss Japheth Koome said the businessman lived alone in the apartment, which is well secured. According to Mr Koome, two security guards who were on duty are missing after the incident happened. &ldquo;We suspect the guards are behind the incident, but a hunt is ongoing,&rdquo; said Koome. &nbsp;
