Sigiri Bridge, a&nbsp;Jubilee Government flagship project worth Sh1.2 billion has collapsed just two weeks&nbsp;after President Uhuru inspected and&nbsp;launched it in Budalangi. President Uhuru Kenyatta said the bridge would significantly reduce deaths and make it easier for the residents to access markets, schools and hospitals. Via twitter Sigiri Bridge was designed as an aid to cross River Nzoia where several people have died in the past while attempting to get across. The Chinese construction Company Covec started setting up the bridge in February 2016 and its completion was scheduled for July. Uhuru promised that the government would construct the bridge to prevent more deaths after nine people died in 2014 while crossing River Nzoia.
