Hundreds of striking nurses on Monday took to the streets to demonstrate against failure by the Government to consider their controversial collective bargaining agreement. Led by Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) officials, they insisted that the ongoing strike was legal and there was no turning back until the CBA was signed. &quot;No amount of intimidation or blackmail will diffuse the resolve by nurses to push for the signing of the negotiated and agreed CBA by both levels of government,&quot; said KNUN Secretary General Seth Panyako. Mr Panyako said the Council of Governors and Ministry of Health were aware of their demands, adding that they were well within their legal rights to demand payment. &quot;We are doing everything within the provision of the law,&quot; said Panyako.
