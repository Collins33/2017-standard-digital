Former employees of an American tobacco company have accused the firm of withholding their dues. The 258 workers were laid off in 2015, when Alliance One Tobacco scaled down their operations in Kenya. In an affidavit filed in court, their representative, Dick Ochieng, said they had been condemned to a life of poverty and suffering after losing their jobs. &quot;Even worse, the company has not paid us as promised,&quot; he said. But Alliance One Tobacco claimed it paid terminal dues to 17 of the claimants and another seven were due for payment. Paulette Kankhwende, the regional human resources director, wants the suit thrown out until all claimants prove they worked for the company.
