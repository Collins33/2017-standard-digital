A man was yesterday sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of defiling an 11-year-old girl. Anthony Saiso shocked the court when he requested Nairobi magistrate Hellen Onkwani to direct that the girl be tested for HIV to find out whether she could be infected with HIV like him. &ldquo;I urge this court to order that the complainant be examined to establish her status because I am HIV positive so that she can be put on anti-retroviral care before it is too late,&rdquo; Mr Saiso stated. In making the ruling, Ms Onkwani said people like Saiso needed to be avoided because they were dangerous to the society. The offence was committed on June 25, 2016 at Kibiko Estate in Ngong, Kajiado County. &ldquo;
