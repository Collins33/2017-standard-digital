&nbsp; Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka conglatulates Wavinya Ndeti outside Milimani courts .The court cleared Wavinya to run for Machakos county governor. 21/6/2016 PHOTO BY GEORGE NJUNGE The High Court on Wednesday&nbsp;overturned a decision to block Wavinya Ndeti from contesting the Machakos County governorship. Ms Ndeti had been declared a member of two parties by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) dispute resolution committee. But yesterday, High Court judge George Odunga ruled that IEBC&#39;s committee had no powers to determine whether Ndeti was a member of Wiper Democratic Movement or Chama Cha Uzalendo, as the same matter had been raised before the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal. The former assistant minister listened pensively to the judge and sometimes smiled for the clicking cameras. The courtroom erupted into celebration when it became clear that Mr Odunga&#39;s finding had tilted in her favour. Ndeti and her supporters recited the Lord&#39;s Prayer immediately after the judge left, before taking the celebrations outside the court premises where hundreds of Wiper party supporters joyfully waved placards.
