A man has taken the Government to court for failing to stop National Super Alliance presidential candidate&nbsp;Raila Odinga from vying in the August 8 polls. Charles Mwangi now wants President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered to form a special commission to investigate Attorney General Githu Muigai, anti-graft commission chairman Eliud Wabukala, electoral commission chairman Wafula Chebukati and Inspector General Joseph Boinnet. &quot;Prof Muigai, Mr Wabukala, Mr Chebukati and Mr Boinnet are solely responsible for Mr Odinga&#39;s candidature and should be suspended from office. They failed to investigate Mr Odinga to ascertain if he has the integrity to be president,&quot; he said. Mr Mwangi also wants the court to order Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to cancel the clearance certificate it issued to the NASA presidential candidate until it is proven that he has the integrity to hold the top job. According to the petitioner, Mr Odinga was to blame for the 2007-2008 post-election violence for calling his supporters to mass action instead of going to court to challenge the election outcome. He accused Boinnet and Muigai of failing to form a special unit to investigate and prosecute&nbsp;Raila&nbsp;over his role in the violence that rocked the country following the disputed presidential results in 2007.&nbsp; ALSO READ: NASA adopts new campaign strategy
