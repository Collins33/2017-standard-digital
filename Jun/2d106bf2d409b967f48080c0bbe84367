Independent candidates in Marakwet East constituency have launched a charm offensive to unseat the incumbent. Former Cabinet Minister Linah Jebii Kilimo and Sawachan Kinur, both independent candidates, have launched a two-pronged campaign strategy to deny Kangogo Bowen of Jubilee a second term in Parliament. Political observers say the race will be a cutthroat contest among the three who command a fanatic support in the region with over 35,000 registered voters. &ldquo;It will be a race of independents and Jubilee, which can go either way. All the candidates have good manifestos,&rdquo; observed Sammy Korir, a local resident. Kinur, a philanthropist, and Kilimo have separately been crisscrossing the rugged terrain in the region to woo voters ahead of the August poll, criticising the incumbent for not fulfilling his 2013 pledges. Kilimo, who has an impressive development track record when she served as area MP between 2003 and 2012, was floored in the Jubilee primaries, an exercise she dismissed as a sham.
