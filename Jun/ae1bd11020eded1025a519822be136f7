A woman was killed on Friday after supporters of rival political parties clashed in Bungoma town. The woman, whose details are yet to be revealed, is said to have been hit by a stray bullet. Trouble started when supporters of Jubilee and Ford Kenya governor aspirants clashed in the town centre. Ford Kenya&#39;s Wycliffe Wangamati had just been cleared by the IEBC and was on his way to Bungoma Bus Park where he was to address residents. His supporters clashed with those of Governor Ken Lusaka of Jubilee. Both Lusaka and Wangamati were whisked away by their security officers, with the incumbent heading to Posta Grounds while Wangamati headed out of town for his campaigns. Lusaka&#39;s rally was disrupted, forcing the police to lob teargas and fire in the air to disperse the supporters. &quot;We would like to have a peaceful campaign. Action should be taken on those responsible,&quot; Alfred Khang&#39;ati, the ODM candidate, said. ALSO READ: Sabaot elders give nod to Governor Lusaka and his deputy
