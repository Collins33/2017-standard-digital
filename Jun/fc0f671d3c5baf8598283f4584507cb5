Residents of Turkana County are still buying a packet of 2kg maize flour at Sh175 despite a State subsidy to cushion consumers. A spot check in various parts of the country showed unscrupulous traders had ignored the Government directive for the flour to retail at Sh90 to charge an extra Sh85 on the same. A shopkeeper, who declined to be named for fear of arrest, said the prices could rise further due to logistical costs. &ldquo;The price may rise as we get the commodity at a high price probably due to transportation costs,&rdquo; he said.
