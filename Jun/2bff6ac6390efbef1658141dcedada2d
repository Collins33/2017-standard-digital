High Court Judge George Odunga has ruled that Political Parties Tribunal erred and acted against the law by barring Speaker Susan Kihika from Nakuru senatorial race. George Odunga said that the tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter. Susan Kihika went to the High Court to nullify the ruling by the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal excluding her from running for the Senate seat. Ms Kihika, who is the Jubilee Party nominee, was stopped from running on grounds that she had not resigned as speaker. Through lawyer Tom Ojienda, Ms Kihika sought a judicial review order quashing the decision and the entire proceedings by the disputes tribunal. Justice Odunga has quashed Political Parties Disputes Tribunal decision to lock her out of the race. ALSO READ: Tribunal deals blow to Kihika's bid for Senate
