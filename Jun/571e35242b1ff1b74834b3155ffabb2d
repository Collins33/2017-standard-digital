Are we about to read a book on political catwalks and kizungu mingi? This is the message former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Ann Waiguru is sending. She has vowed to write a tell-all book where she will expose all the powerful forces who conspired to bring her down.

She will only know what people think about her dossier if it is published as a headline and permanently displayed in a supermarket. ALSO READ: Barred: Poll shock for big names
