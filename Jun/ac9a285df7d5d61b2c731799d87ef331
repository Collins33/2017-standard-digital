Safaricom will save Sh10 million annually following the ban on plastic bags, which is expected to take effect from August 28 this year. Safaricom regional sales and operations director Steve Okeyo said the ban on single-use plastic bags will enable the company to grow as well as play its role in conserving the environment. &quot;Last year, we carried out a cost-benefit analysis and found that the changeover from plastic bags to reusable bags will attract an average saving of Sh2.5 million per quarter,&quot; Mr Okeyo said. Given enough time Despite a protest by the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, who say they were not given enough time to address the issue, Mr Okeyo said Safaricom had launched the re-usable bags that will help address the situation. &quot;Responsible and effective environmental management offers a host of benefits: improved customer relations, compliance with environmental legislation, increased staff pride, reduced waste generation, and efficient energy consumption,&quot; he said, adding that the ban would also help address the problem of waste management and land degradation.

The eco-friendly reusable bags, Okeyo said, are part of efforts to raise awareness ahead of the ban on plastic bags for household and commercial use. &quot;As a corporate championing a clean environment, we are key players in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals by churning out products that will address the current problems of waste management,&quot; he said. After August 28, no more permits will be issued to companies that manufacture plastic bags. The Kenya Bureau of Standards has also announced that the existing licences will be cancelled.
