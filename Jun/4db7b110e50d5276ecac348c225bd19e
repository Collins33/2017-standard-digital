OLX has registered an increase in sale of helicopters in the run-up to the August General Election. The e-commerce firm says the increase could be attributed to the upcoming elections that will see some politicians use the machines to campaign around the country. &ldquo;There has been a spike in the number of choppers posted on OLX in the past two months. In March, we only had two choppers compared to April and May, where we sold between eight and 10 choppers a month,&rdquo; said OLX Country Manager Peter Ndiang&rsquo;ui. &nbsp;
