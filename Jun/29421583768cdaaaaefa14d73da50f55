Nairobi residents have backed a new bill that requires shoppers to pay for plastic bags in order to control the environmental menace. The Plastic Control Bill 2016 is awaiting approval by Governor Evans Kidero. The Bill passed by Karura Ward MCA Kamau Thuo proposes that Nairobi residents should pay for plastic bags they use to carry goods they have purchased from supermarkets, small corner shops, grocery stores and other large stores. Thuo, who is also an environmentalist, said the law would ensure less people used the paper bags, which would in turn reduce littering. He said that the plastics were non-biodegradable and this posed a threat to the eco-system. &quot;By introducing a levy on the plastics, many people will shy away from using them and this will be a good step forward in environmental conservation,&quot; said Thuo. Ibrahim Mutiso, a retail shop owner, welcomed the bill saying it will put an end to blocked drainage which he attributes to the poorly disposed plastic bags. He said that blocked drainage have seen him lose clients who are deterred by the foul smell. Patrick Olunga, a city resident, called for the re-introduction of the brown paper bags.
