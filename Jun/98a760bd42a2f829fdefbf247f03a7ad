It&rsquo;s shocking that a gender pay gap still exists and that 80 percent of industries are guilty of paying men more than women for doing the same job. But there is a tiny glimmer of hope as the wage gap is at its lowest since records began, at 18.1 percent. And there are industries where things are more equal with a less than 10 percent difference in pay - and jobs where women can earn more than men. Research for commercial property firm savoystewart.co.uk has revealed the highest paid jobs for women. The biggest percentage of these industries, 40 percent, require an educational background that involves a STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subject. This is an area that is constantly being pushed to try and encourage more girls to study STEM subjects after the age of 16 to bridge the gender gap of workers.
