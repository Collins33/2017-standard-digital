Narc-Kenya gubernatorial candidate for Kirinyaga Martha Karua was shouted down at her opponent&rsquo;s Kithure village. The residents accused her of turning her back on various projects within Ngariama and Njukiine wards yet they voted for her for 20 years. The two wards formed the then larger Ngariama location which is vote-rich within Gichugu Constituency of Kirinyaga East Sub-County. On failing to be given any audience by the angry residents, Karua and her entourage drove to the neighbouring Kamwana Market and got the same cold reception. The residents claimed the roads were pathetic. She was accompanied by her running mate Gachoki Gitari. The area is the home ground of the Jubilee gubernatorial opponent Anne Waiguru who hails from Kiamugumo village which lies between Kithure and Kamwana markets.

They cited the now stalled tarmacking of Kutus-Kianyaga-Kiamutugu &ndash;Kithure road which has been a nightmare to them for many years. &#39;&#39;You abandoned us during the hour of need and it our time now to vote for a leader who has the interest of her people,&#39;&#39; they shouted. The road in question saw president Uhuru Kenyatta and his entourage get stuck for five hours when he attended the homecoming of the then Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru (now gubernatorial candidate).
