Mombasa&nbsp;Governor Hassan Joho has asked police officers not to implement &quot;illegal orders&quot; issued to them. The&nbsp;governor&nbsp;warned that they would at some point be held accountable for the same. Speaking during celebrations to mark the 54th Madaraka Day, Mr Joho said police must serve all equally and not act in a partisan manner. Joho, who was blocked from attending the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) launch on Wednesday, warned officers against frustrating Opposition leaders and instead be neutral as civil servants. He also warned those using social media to send hate messages and inciting the public during the campaigns that they would be prosecuted. &quot;For those of you who execute illegal instructions, you will be held responsible at some point. If police officers agree to be used as Jubilee brokers, then we are monitoring and timing you. I am not going to be always in the Opposition. After this election, I am sure I will be in Government,&quot; said Joho who was, apparently referring to Wednesday when police blocked him from attending the SGR&nbsp; launch. Meanwhile, Mombasa County Commissioner Evans Achoki has said he would call a meeting with all aspirants and schedule political rallies to avoid cases of politicians clashing over venues for rallies, as he warned politicians against disrupting rivals&#39; rallies.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Nairobi city askaris to undergo Sh80 million makeover
