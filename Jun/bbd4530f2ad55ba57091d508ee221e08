The only reason I would support arming residents in the banditry-prone areas is to offer self-defence. The bandits are well armed and are not primarily against the armed security officers but unarmed residents who need to be empowered to secure themselves because they are helpless and unprotected from the bandits. When residents are armed, they can thwart some attacks and protect their property because they rely on security men who are not entirely on the ground and can offer protection immediately it is needed. So far the arming of the Kenya Police Reservists (KPR) is similar to arming residents. The KPR officers are children of the community that are battling with this insecurity and we have seen them help reduce the rate of attacks and theft because they understand the terrain and nature of the aggressors, some who are known to them. The bandits are just a few criminal members of the society and through a formula like community policing they can be easily identified and rooted out if the residents themselves are empowered even beyond being armed. It could be seen not to be the best solution but the situation as it is requires community involvement because the government by itself is facing some challenges. The important thing is for the Government to come up with a comprehensive structure of monitoring the usage of the arms to avoid them being used for the same criminal activities they are supposed to avert. The Government&#39;s commitment is the most basic foundation in this battle.
