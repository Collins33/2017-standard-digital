A group of public service vehicle (PSV) operators have sued manufactures for allegedly selling them mechanically-faulty buses. Through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, the PSV owners accused Toyota Kenya Ltd and Nairobi Hino Ltd of selling them vehicles that develop mechanical problems as soon as they hit the road. &quot;The vehicles are sold as brand new but develop fatal engine and overheating problems, brake system failures and chassis cracking as soon as they begin business. What&#39;s worse is that the new models do not have spare parts in the market,&quot; said Mr Kinyanjui. Among the complainants were City Star Shuttle Ltd, which operates a fleet of buses across various estates in Nairobi, and Chania Shuttle Ltd, which operates long-distance buses. Kinyanjui said after the buses purchased started developing mechanical problems, the owners reported the matter to Toyota Kenya Ltd, which recalled the vehicles. But the company was delaying their release.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Left Foot action resumes with big win for MP Shah
