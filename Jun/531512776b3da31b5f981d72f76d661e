Traders in Ololung&#39;a trading centre in Narok South made losses after fire suspected to have been caused by an electric fault burnt 30 business premises. The fire, which started at around 7pm on Wednesday, spread fast through the semi-permanent buildings that hosted kiosks, boutiques, eateries and other businesses. James Njoroge said he lost property worth more than Sh800,000 after two of his shops were damaged.&nbsp;&quot;I left for a bit but after a few minutes I got information that the place was on fire. I rushed back and could not believe my eyes - everything had been turned to ashes,&quot; he said. A seven-year-old child was rescued with minor injuries.
