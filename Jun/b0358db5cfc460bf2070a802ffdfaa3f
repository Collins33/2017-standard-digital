A court has ordered a 45-year-old man to leave his father&#39;s compound and move to the land he has been allocated. In 2011, the applicant, JO from Mateka village, asked his son MO to relocate to his own six acres in Kisa. But MO declined and preferred to live in his father&#39;s compound. Interventions by the clan and area chief did little to change MO&#39;s mind. Fed up with his son&#39;s behaviour, the former Mumias Sugar employee went to the High Court in Bungoma seeking orders to force MO to leave. JO sought to demonstrate to Justice Ndung&#39;u Mukunya that he had done everything to prepare his son to face the world on his own.

I took him to study carpentry and went further to open a workshop for him. But he ran the business down,&quot; said JO. Later, JO said, he used Sh100,000 from his retirement package to open and equip another workshop for MO, who once again ruined it. &quot;I therefore want the defendant to go to Kisa, my ancestral land, and occupy the portion that is clearly demarcated,&quot; JO said in his court papers. &quot;I have tried to have the dispute resolved by the clan but MO has completely refused to go to Kisa.&quot; JO said his first born was rude, disrespectful and had even threatened to beat him up. He also produced a complaint he had written to the chief about his son. Face life Justice Mukunya ruled that MO was no longer a child and must face life on his own. He gave him 60 days to leave his father&#39;s compound.

But he is an adult and can no longer be a dependant of the plaintiff. He has been well prepared to face the world on his own. He cannot cling to his father&#39;s land and live there by force when his father wants him to leave,&quot; Mukunya said. The judge said MO would be removed by force if he did not leave in the allocated time.&nbsp;
