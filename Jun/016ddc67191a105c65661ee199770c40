&nbsp; The AIC Kijabe Hospital has launched a third satelite medical clinic in Nairobi to ease access to affordable healthcare in the region. Speaking Wednesday at the launch of the clinic in Azure Towers Westlands upper market, the hospital acting CEO Ken Muma said the opening of the clinic was part of a competitive strategy to bring services closer to the people. &quot;Our competitive strategy driven by our Christian values offers us a playground that ensures we provide quality health care to Kenyans. We seek to impact on the overall health services in the region,&quot; Dr Muma said. Dr Mumo said the hospital would bridge the health service provision gap by continuously training health professionals and having the facility staffed with trained medical personnel drawn from the main hospital.
