President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto have made sensational claims that opposition leaders want General Election postponed after sensing defeat. They spoke of a scheme by the National Super Alliance (NASA) that is calculated towards having a coalition government between Jubilee and the Opposition outfit once they succeed to have the election postponed to December. &quot;NASA leaders are trying to force Kenyans to allow them join the Government through the backdoor just as they did during the Grand Coalition government whereby they forced retired President Mwai Kibaki to share power with them.&quot; &quot;But we are telling them that the Constitution states clearly that the general election must be held on second week of August this year,&quot; said Uhuru. The head of state said that it was clear in the minds of all Kenyans that the elections would be held on August 8. &quot;For long my deputy and I have yielded to numerous demands by the opposition on how the electoral body should be reformed. They called for the disbandment of the IEBC, we gave in. They then went to court over the biometric Voter Register (BVR), we never opposed and now they have fresh demands on the printing of ballot papers, which we are ready to let them decide on who will print them,&quot; said the President. Speaking in Kericho County where they took their re-election campaign after exploits in the North Rift region, the duo said issues raised by the NASA presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga about the Sh2.5 billion ballot papers printing tender were part of the opposition wider scheme to stop the August polls.
