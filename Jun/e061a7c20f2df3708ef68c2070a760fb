(Photo: Reuters) David Rank, the charg&eacute; d&#39;affaires of the US Embassy in Beijing, has left the State Department over the Trump administration&#39;s decision to quit the 2015 Paris agreement to fight climate change, a senior US official has said. A State Department spokeswoman confirmed Mr Rank&#39;s departure, but said she was unable to verify Twitter posts that said he resigned as he felt unable to deliver a formal notification to China of the US decision last week to quit the agreement. &quot;He has retired from the foreign service,&quot; said Anna Richey-Allen, a spokeswoman for the department&#39;s East Asia Bureau. &ldquo;Mr. Rank has made a personal decision. We appreciate his years of dedicated service to the State Department.&rdquo; Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, President Donald Trump&#39;s pick as the next US ambassador to Beijing, is expected to take up the post later this month. A tweet from China expert John Pomfret quoted unnamed sources as saying that Rank had resigned as he could not support Trump&#39;s decision last week to withdraw from Paris deal.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Trump's unlikely gift to Europe and how it could lead to new world order
