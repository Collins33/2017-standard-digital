KCB Bank Kenya has announced the extension of the KCB Lions&rsquo; Den Season Two applications deadline, from May 31 to June 5, 2017. The move is aimed at giving time to more budding entrepreneurs to get a chance to participate in the show. KCB Lion&rsquo;s Den seeks entrepreneurs looking for financial, social and intellectual capital for their new and innovative businesses in Kenya. KCB Group Director, Marketing and Communications Angela Mwirigi has called on interested entrepreneurs to take the opportunity and send applications. &quot;We saw the need to add 5 more days to allow more entrepreneurs to participate in the show,&quot; Ms Mwirigi says. In the Second Season, audiences will engage with the contestants as they battle in the Den on KTN, Standard Group&rsquo;s television station. In April this year, KCB Bank Kenya partnered with The Standard Group for the show whose aim is connecting young entrepreneurs with successful venture capitalists who have already cut their teeth in the business world.
