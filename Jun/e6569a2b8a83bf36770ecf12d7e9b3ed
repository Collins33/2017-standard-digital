Aspirants contesting as independents and in political parties in the North Rift are still resisting calls for a &#39;six-piece suit&#39; voting pattern as advocated for by Jubilee Party. President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto were in the region last week and asked voters to vote for Jubilee nominees vying for positions as Members of the County Assembly all the way to the President. Although residents assured them of solid support for the presidential vote, the top party leaders however encountered some defiance in some regions where the electorate indicated that they would make their own choices for other candidates.
