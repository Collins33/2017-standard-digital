A business woman in Makueni County was Tuesday arraigned in Makindu law courts and charged with swindling customers by hiking the price of maize flour and selling a 2kg packet at Sh140 instead of the government recommended Sh90. Jacinta Mwikali, who operates a shop in Kiboko market along Mombasa-Nairobi Highway, had been arrested following an operation conducted on Saturday by the Makindu Assistant County Commissioner (ACC) Auma Anyumba with the help of area Chiefs. The state counsel told the court that the accused had committed an offence by selling an essential commodity at a higher price contrary to essential goods act No.26 of 2011 section 5. Jacinta Mwikali had appeared before Senior Resident Magistrate David Ndungi in Makindu law courts where she was charged with the offense which attracts a penalty of up to Sh1 million. She was released on a heavy bond of Sh500,000 and a surety of the same amount. On May 16, the Government through a gazette notice announced the price control of essential goods, giving subsidies to maize importers as a way of reducing the cost of maize flour which had sky rocketed.
