Nairobi city inspectorate officers are set to get a complete makeover. The officers popularly known as &lsquo;Kanjo&rsquo; will receive new look uniforms and biometric cards with their bio-data for easier identification. This will cost the county approximately Sh80 million. The officers and other county employees are also undergoing a culture change training to shed off the old &lsquo;Kanjo&rsquo; mentality. County Secretary Robert Ayisi Thursday confirmed that the tendering process on the uniform had begun. &ldquo;We had gazetted the acquisition of the new uniforms and even set aside money in the budget for the same. We got approval and we are now fast tracking procurement of the same,&rdquo; said Ayisi. The biometric cards, he said, had already been procured and issued to a few members of staff on a trial basis. With the cards, city residents will be able to identify genuine and bogus county askaris. Some 650 new officers, including firefighters, will be expected to take charge of security operations in the county. Ayisi said&nbsp;Governor&nbsp;Evans Kidero had embarked on the process of re-branding the city inspectorate. He said the&nbsp;governor&nbsp;had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Police Service Commission and the county government that would see the police service take charge of the recruitment process.

Most of the firemen now are not able to respond to emergencies when need arises and that is why we need a change,&rdquo; said Ayisi. He said the police service will train the new officers before commencing their duties.
