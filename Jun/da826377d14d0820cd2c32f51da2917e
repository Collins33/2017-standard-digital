The man who sold his land to campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election has made good his pledge and held his first rally, which was attended by nearly 200 people. Michael Omondi, a former convict who attributed his freedom to the intervention of the President, yesterday began his self-financed rallies in Kisumu for Uhuru&rsquo;s re-election. The rally, which started with less than 100 youths, later attracted more people who were eager to hear what he had to say. Omondi, a not-so-skilled speaker, chose his words carefully, dwelling on the latest announcement by President Kenyatta that East African Breweries Limited (EABL) would put up a Sh15 billion plant in Kisumu to employ more than 100,000 people. &ldquo;The new Constitution has opened up the country&rsquo;s democratic space and I want to tell you that time has come when we must only choose leaders who mean well for us. The Jubilee government has done a commendable job in developing the country and their promises now contain good things for this region,&rdquo; he told the crowd. When he realised that the crowd was not as receptive as he had hoped, he took time to inform them of the news that was breaking at the moment &ndash; the planned brewery.

Is this not the development we want?&rdquo; he asked the crowd. He said he would ensure that the President visits Kisumu so that he can tell the people what plans he had for them. Omondi (above) said he would run solo rallies, claiming that the Jubilee camp in the region was not up to the task.
