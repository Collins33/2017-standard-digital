President Uhuru Kenyatta, the&nbsp;Jubilee Party leader, steered clear of endorsing any candidate for the Kirinyaga County governor&rsquo;s seat. Former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru&nbsp;is now on her own as she battles it out with Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua . Despite being the candidate for the favourite party in the area, Jubilee,&nbsp;Waiguru&nbsp;finds herself on an equal footing with the flower party leader. Due to the support that Uhuru commands in the county and the popularity of his party, a good word from Uhuru has the potential of tilting the race. In some regions, especially Mt Kenya and Rift Valley, which voted for the party almost to a man in 2013, securing the ticket is akin to winning an election.&nbsp;Waiguru&nbsp;won the ticket after seeing off Karua&rsquo;s running mate, Kirinyaga Central MP Joseph Gitari, and incumbent Joseph Ndathi. With stiff competition from Karua,&nbsp;Waiguru&nbsp;needed to make it clear that she was the President&rsquo;s preferred candidate if she was to have a fairly easy time on August 8. But during his campaign in the county on Wednesday, Uhuru struck a delicate balance between who of the two powerful women to give his backing to. &ldquo;All these leaders support me and the choice between&nbsp;Waiguru&nbsp;and Karua, you will have to make yourself. On August 8 we will see what Kirinyaga has decided. The one who will lose will be accommodated in my administration,&rdquo; Uhuru said.
