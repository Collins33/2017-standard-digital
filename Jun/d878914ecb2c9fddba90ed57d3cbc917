Nairobi governor candidate Peter Kenneth has dragged Deputy President William Ruto into Nairobi County&#39;s charged politics. A day after his rival Senator Mike Sonko (Nairobi) asked him to shelve his political ambitions, Mr Kenneth, who is running as an independent candidate, said the DP had a hand in his miserable performance in the Jubilee Party primaries. &quot;We did not lose the Jubilee nominations because my opponent was assisted by somebody high up in the party hierarchy. Our opponent was assisted by somebody who wanted to cut me to size politically,&quot; he said. Speaking in Mlango Kubwa, Mathare constituency, where he was campaigning yesterday, Kenneth alleged that Sonko&#39;s supporters voted multiple times resulting in a fraudulent election. &quot;The ensured that they voted twice, thrice, 10 times, and the worst case was where an individual voted a record 51 times,&quot; Kenneth told a crowd. He said Sonko was not capable of running the city county.

He may have a new suit every day but his brains and thinking remain the same. Even with new suits, Sonko has not changed; he is merely hiding behind those suits,&quot; he said. Kenneth&#39;s scathing attack comes just a day after Sonko extended an olive branch and asked him (Kenneth) to support his bid, promising to ensure that he was appointed after the August polls.
