Agricultural Society of Kenya (ASK)&nbsp;Northern Kenya chairman Stanley Mukaria has urged farmers to embrace modern agricultural technologies. Speaking at the official opening of the Meru ASK show, Mukaria said the 2017 theme is promoting innovation and technology in agriculture and trade. He said farmers&nbsp;have plenty to learn in the agribusiness from advanced demonstration plots with all the varieties of food crops grown in the region. He said although different activities would be showcased at the fete, agribusiness was the major focus. &quot;We recognise that the use of technology is making agriculture more profitable. Come and see modern trends of farming machinery being used to make farming very attractive,&quot; he said. &nbsp;During the opening, some 62 exhibitors had already put their stands in the show ground.
