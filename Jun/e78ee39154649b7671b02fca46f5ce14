A bunch of MPs who lost in the party nominations and have no chance of making it to parliament are now trying to make the best of their remaining days as honourable members. Grapevine has learnt these MPs are desperately looking for foreign trips to get allowances as much as they can. Some have been heard pleading that they be considered for any parliamentary trip that may arise, regardless of whether they belong to the committees or not.
