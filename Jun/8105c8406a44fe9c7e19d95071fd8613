Kisumu residents are worried over the fate of the Sh4 Billion Lake Basin Development Authority mall, which has been facing the auctioneers hammer after it allegedly failed to pay close to Sh2 billion owed to a local bank. Local MPs and MCA&#39;s have been holding demonstrations and addressing media conferences to push treasury to repay the loan. Following the protests, the government promised to start servicing the loan. But residents are now worried that everything has fallen silent. Even the legislators no longer speak about the mall and are busy campaigning.
