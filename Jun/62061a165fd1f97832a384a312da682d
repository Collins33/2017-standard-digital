Nairobi is expected to face major traffic snarl-ups from 6.00pm on Saturday June 24 to 25 following closure of some roads to allow for the offloading of transformers and cable wire among other apparatuses that will be used to upgrade Cathedral Kenya Power Station along Uhuru highway. Mombasa Road, Uhuru Highway, University Way and Kenyatta Avenue will be the most affected road during the period. Motorists have been advised to avoid the road on the two days.
