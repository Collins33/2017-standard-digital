The main suspect in the killings of three children has pleaded not guilty to murder. Appearing before Justice Daniel Ogembo at the High Court in Eldoret, Enoch Onsanse denied all three charges of murder read to him by the court clerk. Mr Onsanse was accused of killing Clifford Nyambane, six, Tanny Nyamweya, five, and Glen Ongaki, three, at Moi&#39;s Bridge in Eldoret West on May 13, 2017, with others not in court. The three were the children of James Ratemo, the Kanu MCA aspirant for Kapsoya. Mr Ratemo is the suspect&#39;s brother. A mention was set for June 20 and the hearing for July 3.&nbsp;
