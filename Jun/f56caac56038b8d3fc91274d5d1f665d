According to the Global Gender Report, women are underpaid, getting Sh62 per hour compared to men who take home Sh100 for the same period. These disparities came to the fore in Nairobi yesterday during a discussion by the commission on the status of women stakeholders&#39; forum. During the meeting, it emerged access to education was the leading factor to occupation segregation in the country.
