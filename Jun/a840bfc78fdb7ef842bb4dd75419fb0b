Kibet, who was a senior corporate affairs and communications officer at Kenyatta National Hospital, died on Monday at the same hospital, shortly after suffering a seizure outside his home. Angela Gichuru, Kibet&#39;s wife, said their 10-year-old marriage proved that Kibet was a kind, loving and virtuous person who valued his family and guided his three children to live an honourable life. &quot;I will cherish the moments we shared,&quot; she said. To his colleagues, Kibet was always ready to help. &quot;When I get to the office now, it is obvious that something missing. His smile would light up every corner,&quot; said his boss, Simon Ithai.
