IED attack in Lamu that left eight people dead on Wednesday will undoubtedly revive the debate about the reliability of Chinese made APCs. When the 30 APCs were secretly acquired in February 2016, ostensibly to help in the fight against interior terrorism and organised crime, experts questioned their safety following three incidents a few days into their use. In the first case, the windscreen of one carrier was shattered in the middle of an operation. In another case, security personnel complained that some APCs were leaking while others lacked proper ventilation to conduct operations in Coast and Northern Kenya. In another incident, a group of General Service Unit personnel requested the suppliers to prove the vehicle&#39;s durability and efficiency in the field. The officers wanted the supplier to get into the APC and drive past them as they shot at it at close range.

He said he would not endanger his life by getting into the APC as we shot at it because it was not safe. We were all shocked,&quot; said an officer aware of the practice. When the story broke in the media questioning the safety of the APCs police headquarters defended the machines. &quot;The machines have helped in securing officer in operations,&quot; said police spokesman, Charles Owino. Mr Owino said the APCs were on a one-year warranty from their manufacturers, and that a Chinese technical team was in Kenya supervising their maintenance, usage and general performance. &quot;So far, the APCs have clocked 5,000 kilometres and are due for routine service. The air conditioning system is working well with the tyres in good condition. The APCs can run for over 100 kilometres on flat tyres,&quot; he said.

The carriers were deployed to Mandera, Elwak, Liboi, Amuma, Mangai, Basuba, Milimani, Mkowe, Mugumumbi and Mangai and Barago, Tot and Arabai in West Pokot. President Kenyatta commissioned the vehicles at a low-key ceremony attended by Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet. They were driven to GSU headquarters under heavily armed escort. The Government said the vehicles were part of a multi-billion shilling plan to equip and modernise the police force. Also shipped in was a range of security hardware including guns and bullet proof vests. ALSO READ: More police officers killed in Liboi IED attack
