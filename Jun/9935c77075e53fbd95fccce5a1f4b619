Yesterday, Jubilee Party released its manifesto for the period 2017 to 2022. Today, the National Super Alliance is set to release theirs. Political party manifestos outline what parties intend to achieve for the citizens should they get the mandate to form the government. Thus, manifestos are nothing new in the world of politics. Manifestos are often couched in flowery language. They give promises which, if implemented to the letter, would leave citizens no room for complaints over service delivery. But the tragedy over the years has been that manifestos are nothing more than empty promises that the incumbent government fails to implement after getting into power.This is the second time Jubilee has given its manifesto, but the question is whether the party has even achieved half the target it set itself at the beginning of 2013. While Jubilee promised job creation, special consideration for the marginalised and women, laptops for class one kids, improved healthcare and better pay for doctors and nurses, including the building of five stadiums in Kisumu, Mombasa, Eldoret, Garissa and Nakuru; that largely remains unfulfilled. This failure to deliver waters down any new promises the party makes. The Opposition could find itself in the same predicament if it succeeds in unseating Jubilee in the August polls. Nevertheless, manifestos should not be unveiled merely to fulfil a requirement. They should be serious documents detailing the deliverables, for at the end of five years, the Government will be called to account.&nbsp;
