Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot in white shirt NAIROBI, KENYA: Thirdway Alliance Party of Kenya is calling on Kenya&rsquo;s electoral body (IEBC) to cancel ballot printing tender awarded to a Dubai firm to avoid chaos in the country. The Alliance is worried by developing story that casts doubts and bias in the transparency of the ballot papers tender to a Dubai firm that, according to media reports, directly solicited for the tender from the President and whose local contacts are members of the President&#39;s family. In a statement, it said the process if these reports are true, the credibility of the upcoming polls have been compromised and Kenyans are being prepared for what is likely to become in the fullness of time, shambolic and disorganized or otherwise rigged elections. &ldquo;We, the Thirdway Alliance Party of Kenya, put IEBC Chairman, Commissioners and Senior Management on notice that they are responsible for any consequence that may result from the conduct of the upcoming polls.&rdquo; ALSO READ: IEBC wants Wavinya Ndeti appeal heard by another judge &ldquo;Particularly, we inform them that Kenyans will hold them responsible for any violence and disruptions that may result from a rigged election.&rdquo; &ldquo;We also put Jubilee Party, and the person of President Uhuru Kenyatta together with his family members herein implicated on notice that they have no business responding on behalf of IEBC unless they are now in bed with IEBC in the unfolding attempt at subverting the elections process.&rdquo; Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot now wants the tender to be awarded to an independent printing firm that has no connection to any party contesting the elections of August 8, 2017. It also proposes United Nations to supervise the tender process.
