The Amani National Congress (ANC) has accused smaller parties from the western Kenya region of using NASA symbols to entice supporters. &nbsp;MPs Alfred Agoi (Sabatia) and Yusuf Chanzu (Vihiga) and national secretary-general Godfrey Osotsi said ANC was one of the five parties that had signed NASA&#39;s pre-election pact. &nbsp;&quot;Parties willing to support NASA and our presidential candidate are welcome. If they want to sign an agreement with us, they must wait until after the elections. &quot; The leaders were speaking at Ivona Primary School in Sabatia during the launch of Agoi&#39;s manifesto and campaign.
