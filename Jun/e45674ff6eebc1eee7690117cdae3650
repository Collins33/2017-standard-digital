Miraa traders in Nyambene, Meru County now want their product exported to Somalia from Isiolo International Airport instead of Wilson Airport in Nairobi County. According to the State, the new airport is expected to decongest Wilson, which handles miraa exports from Meru North. &quot;We waste a lot of time taking miraa to Nairobi - a distance of more than 500km. The Isiolo airport will save us a lot of money as it is only about 50km away,&quot; said Nyambene Miraa Traders Association secretary John Libuke. Also anticipating the new airport are firms from Timau, Meru and parts of Nyeri, who export horticultural products such as flowers and French beans to Western Europe. The country&#39;s fourth largest international airport will be completed on Friday and set for formal take-off by mid-next week. The Sh2.7 billion airport that will also serve seven other neighbouring counties is also set to begin operations at the same time, according to Transport Principal Secretary Paul Maringa. He said domestic flights would start in two weeks&#39; time. ALSO READ: Kenya seeks UN help in lifting ban on exporting of miraa Final work on the 1.4km runway is expected to be completed by Friday.
