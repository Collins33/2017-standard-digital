John Momanyi Ondima claims he worked for Tuskys for 14 years (2001-2015). Mr Odima says for personal reasons, he decided to hang up his boots and in keeping with the law, he gave the firm three months notice through a letter. By the time he left, he had risen through the ranks to become the floor supervisor. &ldquo;Public Eye, what I don&rsquo;t understand is why have they not paid me despite my colleagues getting their pay?&rdquo; asks a dejected Ondima. What angers him most is that he followed the due process by clearing with Tusky&rsquo;s. Tusky&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s now well over two years; sort out this man.
