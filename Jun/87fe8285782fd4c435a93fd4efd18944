National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) is reviewing recordings of remarks made by National Super Alliance (NASA) presidential candidate Raila Odinga during his campaigns in Kajiado County. Jubilee team on Friday termed the remarks as incitement likely to trigger ethnic tension ahead of the General Elections. The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) and officers from the Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP) are backing up detectives from the NCIC in un-coding Raila&#39;s public statement to see if it constituted hate speech, with sufficient evidence to back his criminal prosecution. But as the matter became part of criminal probe, Orange Democratic Party (ODM) leaders were defending their party boss against accusations of incitement, saying his statement was misinterpreted.
