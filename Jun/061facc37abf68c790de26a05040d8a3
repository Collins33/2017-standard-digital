NAIROBI, KENYA: The government on Monday assured consumers of constant supply of Sh90 maize flour ending shortage that has been witnessed in the past few days. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett said he has already received 1.2 million bags of maize and expects another 3.2 million bags to address the shortage. &ldquo;We are going to engage the services of Standard Gauge Railway, RVR and the normal transport system to ensure the maize moves on time from the port to millers,&rdquo; he said adding that the maize will be available in all parts of the country. The assurance comes a day after opposition leader Raila Odinga accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of failing to cushion Kenyans against the high cost of basic commodities. Raila said despite the Opposition calling on the Jubilee administration to put in place measures to address the on-going hunger and unavailability of maize flour in the country, little has been done. &quot;On June 7, we asked Uhuru to immediately fly to Ethiopia and ask his counterpart to sell maize to Kenyans. We also asked the President to fire Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett, his Devolution counterpart Mwangi Kiunjuri and Principal Secretary for Agriculture Richard Lesiyampe for deliberately misleading Kenyans on the famine situation,&quot; Raila said when he addressed the media in Nairobi Sunday.
