A row between the Nairobi City County Government and the State over Sh72 billion debt is now before the Senate. Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero appeared before the Senate Finance Committee where he was taken to task to shed more light on the debts owed to county by the National Government. Governor Kidero narrated to members of the Mandera Senator Billow Kerrow led-committee how all efforts to recover the billions from Government and state corporations have hit a dead end, revealing that services have been paralyzed because of the debts. The Department of Defence(D.O.D), under the Ministry of defence owes city hall Sh61.50 billion on account of land in Embakasi. Other debtors include the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (Sh2.67 billion), Kenya Culture Centre (Sh1.48 billion), Kenya Railway Corporation (221.3 million) and the National Assembly (48.66 million). &ldquo;We have raised the matter with the highest office in the land. We write notices every month, but we have not received any payment. The Senate as a custodian of the counties should help us recover the debts because we cannot auction property of state,&quot; he said.
