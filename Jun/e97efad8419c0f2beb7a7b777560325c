The United States has begun asking some would-be visitors applying for visas to provide their identities on social media, among other more vigorous screening methods. A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP new security procedures had gone into effect on May 25 for travelers deemed to present a risk. In a March 6 memorandum, President Donald Trump vowed to tighten controls on who can enter the United States, the better to ferret out extremists who might pose a threat. According to the US official, consular officers can now demand extra information from applicants they deem to require &quot;more rigorous national security vetting.&quot; &quot;Such visa applicants will be asked to provide additional information, including their social media handles, prior passport numbers, additional information about family members, and a longer history of past travel, employment, and contact information,&quot; she said. Nevertheless, she added, these changes will &quot;affect only a fraction of one percent of the more than 13 million annual visa applicants worldwide.&quot; ALSO READ: Trump offers help on London attacks, touts need for travel ban
