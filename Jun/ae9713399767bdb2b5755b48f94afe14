Kibera Magistrates Court yesterday issued a warrant of arrest against a 28-year-old man accused of masquerading as a doctor. Chief Magistrate Joyce Gandani issued the warrant after the suspect, Ronald Melly, failed to show up for hearing in the case which was scheduled to continue yesterday. The State planned to continue with its case against Mr Melly, after presenting Nairobi University Academic Registrar Benard Waweru on the witness stand. Melly had been released on Sh500,000 bond but now risks being jailed or have the bond increased if he fails to convince the court why he skipped the hearing. The prosecution, through state counsel Zephida Chege, asked the Court to order police to arrest the accused as he did not explain the reason why he skipped the session. Melly is facing a charge of impersonating a medical doctor and a second charge of forging academic certificates to enable him to practice medicine.
