There are concerns in sections of Western Kenya about two mysterious roads. One of the roads has been &#39;officially&#39; launched a number of times now with a lot of&nbsp; funfair. After that, nothing gets done to give it a tarred surface. The other, which links a border town to a neighbouring country, is only tarmacked inside the imagination of a senior government official. Residents are now concerned that somebody could have pocketed or is planning to pocket millions of shillings meant for the two projects. Why, they wonder, would somebody announce publicly that the roads have been tarmacked when it is as clear as daylight that they are not?. &nbsp; &nbsp; ALSO READ: Two more charged with SGR vandalism
