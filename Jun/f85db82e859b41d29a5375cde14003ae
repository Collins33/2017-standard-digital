The National Super Alliance (NASA) presidential campaign team in Nyanza region has asked voters to reject independent candidates. The team also wants residents to vote for Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) candidates. Speaking in Kabondo-Kasipul in Homa Bay, where it launched the NASA presidential campaign, the team led by nominated MP Oburu Oginga and Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga criticised independent candidates, saying many of them were on a revenge mission after losing in the nominations. PARTY PRIMARIES They said that although the NASA co-principals campaigned as a team, parties should pitch for their candidates for various seats at the county level, while at the same time campaigning for the coalition&#39;s presidential candidate, Raila Odinga. Oburu told Nyanza residents to avoid electing candidates of other political parties on grounds that they are affiliated to NASA. This is expected to ruffle feathers among other NASA affiliate parties in the region.
