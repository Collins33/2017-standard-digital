Mount Kenya University (MKU) has been given the green light to offer maritime and transport logistic courses. The Kenya Maritime Authority (KMA) authorised MKU to offer certificate and diploma programmes at its Mombasa campus after reviewing the university&#39;s facilities and resources. Classes started in May with more than 200 students enrolled. Speaking on the sidelines of the just-ended 42nd Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association (Kessha) Annual Delegates Conference, MKU Director of Marketing, Mr Boniface Murigi, said that they were pleased as an institution to offer courses in maritime. &quot;Our presence in the port city of Mombasa gives us an advantage to engage in provision of such courses that have a ready market within the Kenyan coastal belt,&quot; Murigi said.
