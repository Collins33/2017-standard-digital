Two more suspects were Friday&nbsp;detained for 14 days by a magistrate court in Mombasa for allegedly vandalising a section of the Standard Gauge Railway at Mariakani in Kilifi County. David Musyoki Nziu and Nicholas Mutuku John, were brought to court yesterday while Samuel Kamau Maina, Joseph Mbugua and James Ndichu Mburu were charged on the same day. The suspects risk a death sentence if convicted by the court. While launching the project on Wednesday, President Uhuru Kenyatta warned that those who vandalise the rail network will be hanged.&nbsp; Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecution Alexander Muteti said: &ldquo;The respondents were arrested at a yard which they own in possession of assorted railway parts.&rdquo;
