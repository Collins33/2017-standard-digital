A middle aged man was fined Sh10,000 by a Kakamega court for obstructing Rachael Ruto’s motorcade. Evans Muhakwa pleaded guilty of obstructing other road users at Nakumatt junction along Kakamega-Webuye Road on Thursday June 29. The deputy President’s wife was heading to Masinde Muliro University for the national inter-denomination prayers. Muhakwa is said to have blocked the road, being a driver of a passenger vehicle making it difficult for other road users to access the road. In his defense, the accused asked the court to pardon him as he had an ailing wife and children who were all dependent on him. "My wife underwent operation recently and is still in hospital. She left our four children and none of them knows that I am in court today since I was arrested. I plead with the court to forgive me and I won't repeat the mistake again," Muhakwa told the court. Senior Resident Magistrate Erick Malesi ordered the accused to pay the fine or face a three months sentence.
