Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has said his team will only support the strongest NASA candidates for city elective seats. His statement came as cracks began to emerge in the city Opposition camp among aspirants contesting same seats. The most recent was a clash between supporters of Nairobi businessman Fred Oyugi, popularly known as &#39;Dor&#39;, and Jane Wangui during a NASA rally at Dandora Stadium in Nairobi on Saturday. Ms Wangui was given the Orange Democratic Movement nomination certificate after hotly contested primaries, a decision that Oyugi has challenged in court. &quot;While the matter is still in court and we all await the decision, it was quite clear from the crowd (during the Dandora rally) who was the stronger candidate,&quot; said Kidero, adding that they were still pushing for single candidates. &quot;This does not mean that we might achieve this by the end of the day. But even in instances where we will have more than one NASA candidate on the ballot, only the strongest will get the team&#39;s support,&quot; said Kidero.

Kidero says NASA will not repeat the same mistakes the Opposition made in the 2013 elections. &quot;When you look at Makadara Constituency, for example, the combined votes of both ODM and Wiper candidates would have denied the TNA candidate victory,&quot; says Kidero. Benson Mutura won by garnering 37,967 votes. George Aladwa of ODM got 36,183 votes while Lindy Ajiambo of Wiper took home 7,505 votes.
