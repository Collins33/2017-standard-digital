&nbsp; A Nairobi court has directed the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to explain why it locked out presidential aspirant Peter Solomon Gichira from vying in the August 8 General Election. Justice George Odunga, when issuing the directive Monday, said IEBC should also file its response by Tuesday and appear in court for the inter-party hearing on Wednesday. The directive came after Gichira moved to court last week seeking orders to compel IEBC to register him for the race. He filed an application Monday under a certificate of urgency claiming that the decision to lock him out of the race was malicious and in bad faith. &ldquo;I was likely to be excluded from participating in the August 8 General Election after IEBC deliberately disobeyed court orders allowing him to submit his papers,&rdquo; said Gichira. &ldquo;There is real apprehension that IEBC will print ballot papers for the presidential elections and completely lock me out from contesting the general elections in August,&rdquo; he added.
