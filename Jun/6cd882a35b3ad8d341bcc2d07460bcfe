National Super Alliance (NASA) leaders appear to have adopted a new strategy devoid of name-calling and personal attacks in their campaign as they launched the coalition&#39;s manifesto. On Tuesday night, the five NASA co-principals, led by presidential candidate Raila Odinga, in a scripted address at the Ngong Racecourse, did not mention the Jubilee Party or its leaders by name. Even as they launched scathing attacks on the policies and perceived failures of the Jubilee administration, the leaders did not mention President Uhuru Kenyatta or his deputy, William Ruto, by name and instead frequently used the terms &#39;our rivals&#39; and &#39;our competitors&#39;. According to NASA, the new approach, the new messaging through issue-based politics, would not raise animosity among respective party supporters.
