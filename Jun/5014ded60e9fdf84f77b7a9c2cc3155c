Wiper Democratic Movement (WDM) has reacted to utterances by Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze. The MP had issued a statement suggesting that he was in support of President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election. In a statement, the party warned Mr Nyenze of &#39;consequences&#39; if he failed to offer a satisfactory explanation for his statement, whose political import is still not clear. &quot;Hon Nyenze, the Wiper candidate for Kitui West, is quite aware of the consequences of campaigning for a rival party. WDM-K will no doubt be seeking a clarification from the MP as to whether he has, since his nomination as Kitui West parliamentary candidate on WDM-K ticket, shifted his allegiance from our party to a Jubilee candidate, after which we will chart the way forward,&quot; the party said in a statement signed by its Executive Director Jared Siso. Last week, the National Assembly minority leader was captured singing President Kenyatta&#39;s praises during a public function in Ukambani. Speaking in vernacular, the long-serving politician urged Ukambani residents to throw their weight behind Uhuru on the strength of his development record, including the construction of the Standard Gauge Railway and the youth and women empowerment projects.
