There can be no excuse for the incessant lack of the water in the city of Nairobi. There is only one plausible explanation; that many of the officers in the employ of the Nairobi Water Company have been sleeping on the job. More importantly, there are those who stand to benefit personally from the shortages. Most of the water bowsers in the city belong to them. Why, even when the meteorological department posts period updates on the weather pattern, they seem not to have contingency plans in case of drought and during the regular maintenance periods is baffling. Their inability to act in good time is not only inconveniencing, but shameful. The esteem of Nairobi, one of the most vibrant cities on the continent, is diminished by lack of basics like water which, like most of all else that afflicts the city, is not an act of God. The water company needs to adopt innovative ways to harness and conserve water. They ought to move away from traditional sources of water supply; dams and boreholes that are expensive and prone to weather changes. How about encouraging city residents to collect rain water off the roofs of the millions of houses in the city as happens in other cities? In some countries, it is mandatory that new buildings incorporate plans for underground water storage tanks for the purpose of collecting rain water. Water scarcity ought to be contained permanently.
