The recent endorsement of Governor Peter Munya by National Super Alliance (NASA) leaders has stoked fresh controversy over his ties with the Opposition. During their tour of Meru on Saturday, NASA leaders Raila Odinga and Moses Wetang&#39;ula urged residents to re-elect Mr Munya in the August 8 polls. The endorsement triggered intense discussion on social media and elicited sharp reactions from Munya&#39;s competitors, forcing him to defend himself against accusations that he was an Opposition sympathiser. On Monday, Munya&#39;s fiercest rival Kiraitu Murungi said NASA&#39;s endorsement of Munya proved he was with the Opposition. &quot;Munya has a secret deal with NASA. He should not fool people that he is supporting Uhuru anymore,&quot; said Kiraitu. But speaking during a radio show, Munya defended himself, saying he was solidly behind President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election.

The President is expected to visit Meru with other Jubilee leaders over the weekend. Last weekend&#39;s campaign tour by the Opposition has given Munya&#39;s opponents more ammunition to paint him as an Opposition supporter and caused consternation among NASA aspirants for the seat. Winnie Kaburu, who is fighting for the governor&#39;s seat on a Wiper party ticket said she was taken aback by news of the endorsement. On Saturday, Raila and Wetang&#39;ula introduced Ms Kaburu to a crowd in Tigania East. But in the vote-rich Igembe, the two changed their tune and rooted for Munya. Kaburu said she would meet Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka regarding the matter. ALSO READ: Raila back to Kajiado as political dynamics change
