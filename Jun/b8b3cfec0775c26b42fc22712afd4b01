A man was beaten to death on Monday after he was accused of stealing maize from a neighbour&#39;s farm. The 46-year man from Kawuor Bondo village in Kagan West, Rangwe sub-county (Homa Bay County) reportedly confessed that he stole the maize because he was hungry. &quot;He said he had no money to buy maize flour, currently retailing at Sh140 for a 2kg packet,&quot; a resident said. The price of dry maize ranges between Sh150 and Sh170 for a 2kg tin.&nbsp; Most residents say the subsidised maize flour that is supposed to sell at Sh90 is out stock. Witnesses said the man was caught leaving the shamba with a sack full of maize. The crowd descended on him with kicks and blows. County police boss John Omusanga said the man had already died by the time his officers arrived. He appealed to residents not to take the law into their own hands.
