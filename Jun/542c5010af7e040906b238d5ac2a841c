ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has been told to stop telling Kenyans how he was &#39;duped&#39; by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto in 2013. Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali said Mudavadi should not revisit the issue because it portrays him as a &#39;political novice and nonstarter&#39;. Mr Washiali, who is the Jubilee party coordinator in charge of western Kenya, said by confessing that he was duped out of a presidential candidature, Mudavadi was confirming that he has no capacity to lead. Last Saturday, Mudavadi (left) who, together with NASA presidential flag-bearer Raila Odinga, attended the burial of former Mumias MP Francis Obongita at Malaha, accused Uhuru and Ruto of taking advantage of his kindness to dupe him into entering an agreement, only to later disown it. &nbsp;&quot;These guys drove into my home and asked me to sign the agreement that suggested that I would be the presidential candidate, but bolted out of the arrangement. They were not committed to it.&quot; He said the leaders could not be trusted because they disowned a formal agreement even before the ink had dried.&nbsp; ALSO READ: IEBC headache of picking printer for ballot papers
