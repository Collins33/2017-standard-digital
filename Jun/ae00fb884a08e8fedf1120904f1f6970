Safaricom has announced a 36 per cent increase in the amount Kenyan artistes will earn for music sold through its Skiza platform. Musicians will now earn 30 per cent, up from the current 22 per cent they get per song. The amount will be paid through their respective Content Service Providers, who will then pay the musicians in accordance with the contracts they have signed and recent legal directives. &ldquo;The spirit of Skiza was to ensure that Kenyan artistes earn from their creativity. We will commit to continue to explore more ways in which we can empower artistes to help them make a living from their work,&rdquo; said Safaricom Chief Executive Bob Collymore. Musicians on the platform will further benefit from free legal clinics in copyright and entertainment law.
