There was a sombre mood as Kapsoya Ward aspirant James Ratemo&rsquo;s three&nbsp;children&nbsp;were laid to rest at their rural home in Nyangusu, Kisii County, a month after their bodies were discovered in River Nzoia. Tears flowed freely as the caskets of the three minors were brought before the mourners at the family&rsquo;s rural home. The three boys, Clifford Nyambane, six, Dan Nyamweya, five, and Glen Ongagi, were kidnapped by unknown attackers before they were brutally killed and their bodies dumped in River Nzoia. Hundreds of mourners thronged the home as early as 7am in an emotional burial ceremony presided over by Seventh Day Adventist Pastor Thomas Ngoko. Reading from the book of Revelation 20:12, Pastor Ngoko eulogised the young souls that went home too soon. &ldquo;They could forego breakfast to get to church early every Sabbath day. These are innocent lives that Satan has taken away from us,&rdquo; said Pastor Ngoko. The pastor called on the&nbsp;children&rsquo;s&nbsp;father to quit politics and join the church.

There is no need to have earthly things at the expense of the heavenly kingdom,&rdquo; he said. Mr Ratemo, a Kanu aspirant for the Kapsoya Ward thanked the government for the speedy investigations. &ldquo;This is a matter that should be handled by the police and suspects treated as criminals,&rdquo; he said. During the ceremony, politicians were castigated for not supporting the bereaved family. [Eric Abuga]
