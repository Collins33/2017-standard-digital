The examination council has released guidelines for this year&#39;s national examinations. The Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) has also announced tougher measures to curb cheating in this year&#39;s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examinations. Some 972, 837 candidates will sit the KCPE exam for three days from October 31 while another 573,234 candidates will write the KCSE exam between November 3 and November 29. Knec warned of tough penalties for cheating, including a 10-year jail term or Sh2 million fine or both for revealing the contents of examination material to an unauthorised party, whether a candidate or not. The council also warned it would cancel the results for individual candidates or entire examination centres found guilty of irregularities. Cell phones or any other electronic communication devices are prohibited in examination centres. Candidates caught in possession of a cell phone or any other electronic communication device will have their results cancelled.

Candidates who wished to pull out of the KCPE and KCSE should have done so by end of last month. A Knec examinations brief that also contains this year&#39;s timetable instructs all registered candidates to be available for examinations 15 minutes before time. &quot;Present yourself for a search outside the examination room and be seated at your desk table 15 minutes before the time scheduled for the paper. Morning sessions will start at 8.30 am,&quot; said Knec. Candidates who arrive late for the exams will be required to give a satisfactory explanation to the supervisor or risk being locked out.
