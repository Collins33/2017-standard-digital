Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero, Meru&#39;s Peter Munya, Machakos&#39; Alfred Mutua, Senator Mike Sonko and Murang&rsquo;a&#39;s Mwangi Wa Iria are among 106 leaders whose names IEBC has received as facing integrity cases.

Others are Nathif Jama (Garissa), Waithaka Mwangi (Nyandarua), Amoth Rasanga (Siaya), Obado Okoth (Migori),&nbsp; Sospeter Ojaamong Busia),&nbsp; Godana Doyo (Isiolo) and aspirants Anne Waiguru&nbsp; (Kirinyaga) Granton Samboja&nbsp; (Taita Taveta), Hassan Noor (Mandera), Chris Obure (Kisii) andThuo Mathenge&nbsp; (Nyeri) The commission has since written to other state agencies to seek more information on the aspirants. It&#39;s not clear if IEBC will act on the information since majority of those in the list have already been cleared. Only Mombasa aspirant Chitavi Anthony Mkala has been locked out since it was established he had been convicted and paid a fine without appealing. Senate aspirants listed by EACC include Diriye Abdulahi Mohamed (Wajir), David Sifuna (Trans Nzoia) , Kiriiro Kiambi (Tharaka Nithi) and Mithika Linturi (Meru).
