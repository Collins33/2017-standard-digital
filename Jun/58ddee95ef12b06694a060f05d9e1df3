President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday declined to endorse former Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru or Narc-Kenya leader Martha Karua for the Kirinyaga governor&#39;s seat. Uhuru instead promised to work with whoever is elected in the August 8 election. Unlike in previous campaign tours where he campaigned for Jubilee Party candidates, Uhuru steered clear of endorsing any candidate in the Kirinyaga governorship race. Uhuru, who made several stops in the county before addressing a campaign rally at Wang&#39;uru Stadium in Mwea constituency, asked residents to vote for the candidate they preferred, promising to accommodate those that lost in his government.
