The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission dispute resolution tribunal has barred Wavinya Ndeti from vying for Machakos governor seat. The tribunal said it found that her Wiper nomination was irregular. &quot;As at the time of the nomination of Ndeti, she was both a member of Chama Cha Uzalendo (CCU) and Wiper party which is against the law,&quot; said the panel. Ndeti has been fighting to retain her nomination certificate after a petition was filed challenging her eligibility. Some members of the Wiper party sought to block her nomination, arguing that she was still a member of Chama Cha Uzalendo (CCU). The petitioners claimed that Ndeti belongs to two parties and is, therefore, not eligible to be on the ballot as this contravenes the law and the Constitution.
