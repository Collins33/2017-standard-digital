A man who was on death row for 15 years is mobilising resources to campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta, who he says saved him from the gallows. Michael Ochieng Odongo has sold two acres of land for Sh100,000 apiece and is targeting Sh300,000 to stage a campaign in support of Uhuru&#39;s re-election. Mr Odongo, 50, says it was the President&#39;s intervention that saved him from the hangman&#39;s noose after he was condemned to die. &quot;I am not doing this to gain favours from him,&quot; he said. He is targeting to win the President at least 3,000 votes. Odongo was serving time at the Nakuru Main Prison over a robbery with violence in 2001.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Uhuru&rsquo;s bag of goodies for farmers in Western
