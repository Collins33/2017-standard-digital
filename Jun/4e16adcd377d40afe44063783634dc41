There was confusion at the Kenya Technical Training College after&nbsp;Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission officials ran out of toners. &nbsp;They were in the process of printing certificates for candidates in Westlands constituency when this happened. Aspirants had to wait for over two hours for the clearance process to resume. When printing resumed, Liberty Party candidate Sammy Owino was the first one to present his papers followed by Amin Walji of Amani National Congress. Timothy Wanyonyi expressed optimism in retaining his seat after getting cleared. Wanyonyi was presented with the certificate late in the afternoon after the commissioners decided to print everything in black and white.
