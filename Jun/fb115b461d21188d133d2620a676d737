Kenya Railways at the weekend introduced a promotional bus transfer service for all passengers using the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). The service, which kicked off on Saturday and will run up to Tuesday, involves free bus transport for travellers booked on the SGR from the Nairobi Central railway station in town to the Nairobi Terminus in Syokimau. The same buses are also transporting travellers on arrival in Nairobi from Mombasa to the Kencom bus stop in the Nairobi&rsquo;s Central Business District. In Mombasa, the travelers are being picked from the old Mombasa railway station on Mijikenda Street and transported to the Mombasa Terminus in Miritini. Kenya Railways has engaged the National Youth Service (NYS) and Kenya Posta who have provided the buses to facilitate the promotional bus service. The buses will shuttle passengers between the stations every morning at 7am to enable them board the 9am train. The buses will also shuttle passengers scheduled to arrive at 1:30pm to Nairobi&#39;s and Mombasa&#39;s CBD respectively. Tickets are available at the Nairobi and Mombasa Stations on cash or credit card with economy class going for Sh700 and business class at Sh3,000 for adults. According to Kenya Railways, plans are underway to introduce an online platform where travellers can purchase tickets.
