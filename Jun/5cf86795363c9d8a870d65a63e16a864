Online retailer Jumia will offer a 50 per cent discount on a 2kg packet of maize flour on its platform between July 3 and 9. The offer, which is a partnership between the online retailer and Tuskys Supermarket, will be part of activities to mark the Jumia Anniversary Week. Jumia Vendor Relations Manager Benard Kimutai said the offer will go a long way in alleviating the ongoing maize flour crisis in the country. The offer is specifically for the Soko brand.
