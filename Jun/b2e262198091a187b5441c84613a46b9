A primary school in Samburu West Sub County has been closed indefinitely after pupils and teachers clashed over alleged harassment by female teachers. The pupils at Kirimon Primary School descended on teachers with rungus (clubs) on Monday morning and broke classroom windows. They injured two female teachers. Parents who sought anonymity told reporters that this was not the first incident where pupils had attacked teachers at the school. &quot;It is the third time this is happening in this school. The ministry should investigate the root cause of the problem,&quot; said a parent. Others blamed female teachers for defying culture and &quot;subjecting male pupils to shame&quot;. They said it is against the Samburu culture to punish boys in front of girls and said female teachers ought to respect culture.

Morans are very short-tempered and these teachers should understand that,&quot; said another parent. Parents called upon the school management to work closely with the community and involve them in decision-making. They said the school hardly holds teachers, parents and pupils meetings where issues can be raised and solutions reached to avert such incidents. The school&#39;s head teacher, Mr Lewangon Lenantare, was not in was not in the school and our efforts to reach him through his mobile phone for a comment did not bear fruit.
