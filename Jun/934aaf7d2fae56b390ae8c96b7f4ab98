Addressing historical injustices, extra-judicial killings, reconciliation and healing are some of the promises NASA is making to Kenyans. In its 47-page manifesto, the National Super Alliance, as it seeks to wrest power from the Jubilee administration, pledges to correct all past wrongs as well as promise to &ldquo;never again walk on the path of injustice and impunity&rdquo;. Under the leadership of its candidate, Raila Odinga, the Opposition promises to resettle and compensate all internally displaced persons (IDPs) fairly and equally as well as bring back all Kenyans forced to seek refuge in other countries because of past regimes&rsquo; excesses and actions. The issue of land injustices has been a constant factor in the previous elections, with Raila making similar pledges in the 2013 General Election, particularly to the people at the Coast. &ldquo;NASA believes we should endear to right the wrongs of the past and allow Kenyans, individuals and communities, to have a chance to forgive, heal and reconcile. A nation that is not at peace with its past will not be at peace with its present or even future,&rdquo; reads the document in part.
