NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga has claimed that the Dubai firm contracted to print ballot papers has links with Jubilee Party top leaders. Raila said Jubilee Party leaders have had long standing relationship running into more than three years and had held at least two meetings with Dubai firm Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing LLC owners to discuss the award of the tender. Raila, who spoke at the National Elections Conference held at Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) on Tuesday, asked the Independent Electoral Commission (IEBC) to put aside the award so as to protect the integrity of the polls. This new development comes barely a day after IEBC warned that there may be no elections on August 8 should the ballot tender be put aside once again, citing limited time left for the polls. The Opposition chief alleged that the firm hosted Jubilee top honchos in Dubai in February last year, before having another meeting in Nairobi with the firm officials in October 2016. &quot;Information currently in our possession indicate that the firm has long had contacts with senior Jubilee officials for at least three years. Owners of this firm hosted senior Jubilee officials in Dubai in February last year during which the ballot printing tender was discussed,&quot; said Raila.

Raila accused IEBC of ignoring their concerns of the critical tender process, stating that IEBC acted in bad faith to re-award the tender to the firm. He said the decision was &quot;ill-advised and unfortunate&quot; and casts &quot;a dark shadow which could have been avoided over the credibility of the August elections.&quot;
