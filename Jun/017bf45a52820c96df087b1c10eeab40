&nbsp; A group of elderly women from&nbsp;Ngangarithi took to the streets to protest against alleged grabbing of a wetland by private developers. The women, mainly peasant farmers, also accused county officials of colluding with individuals to grab public land. They claimed the county government had allocated public land to private developers. &quot;This not only threatens the ecosystem but locals as well as they depend on the wetland for water for domestic use and irrigation,&quot; said one of the women. Already, a church and residential houses have been built on the wetland that is the source of water for River Githwariga, a tributary of River Tana.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Police kill one suspect after daring robbery in Nyeri town
