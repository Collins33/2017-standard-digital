KISII, KENYA: President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday came into reality with the poor state of roads in Kisii when he opted to drive on some of the worst roads in the region during his two day campaigns in the region. President Uhuru chose to drive through the worst roads in the area in a move that the opposition said was intended to hoodwink residents to vote for Jubilee in the August polls. The President passed through three potholed roads in his trip; Jogoo-Nyatieko, Nyatieko-Nyakoe and Nyachenge-Tabaka. However, it is the Tabaka-Nyachenge&nbsp;road that mesmerized the Head of State who promised to set aside funds for tarmacking of the road which is key in the County&#39;s economic gain. &quot;I am used to flying in the skies but today I must admit that this road is in a poor state. I have heard your cries and once I get to Nairobi I will ensure that we have enough funds to improve the state of this major road,&quot; said President Uhuru.

Kisii residents have been complaining over the state of roads in the region particularly those within the town.
