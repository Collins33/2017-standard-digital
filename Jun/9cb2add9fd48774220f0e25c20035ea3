Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has accused his city governorship opponents for supporting criminal groups and extortionists. The governor said the city had experienced an upsurge in organised crime as well as extortionists. Kidero accused his competitors for the city&rsquo;s top job for being behind the gangs that&nbsp; have reportedly been terrorising residents in Kayole and Komarock. &ldquo;There is an emergence of more organised criminals who are extorting cash from Matatu operators and I believe they have the backing of some politicians in the city,&rdquo; he said. The city chief said the menace had also spread to other slum areas where the gangs demanded protection money from the residents. Speaking during a meeting with the Kenya Alliance of Resident Associations, he said the gangs had a habit of resurfacing before the elections. Gangs back &ldquo;We had managed to do away with the gangs, but they are back. They are targeting minibuses which make up a large percentage in the transport sector,&rdquo; he said.

Meanwhile, Kidero hit out at the electoral agency for failing to take action against politicians campaigning during the night. He said a majority had been campaigning after 6pm and buying supporters alcohol and other drugs. &ldquo;Such actions compromise security in the city and I am urging the polls body not to allow campaigns beyond 6pm,&rdquo; he said. He, however, did not mention the politicians by name.
