Kirinyaga Jubilee Party governor candidate Anne Waiguru has intensified her campaigns by putting on notice people who have grabbed public land. Ms Waiguru expressed outrage over the grabbing of land meant for research in the area and wondered how the county could attain its millennium goals. &quot;I&rsquo;m aware that land set aside for the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (Kalro) in Kimbimbi and Mathangauta villages in Mwea has been grabbed. Let me assure you that whether the grabbers have developed it or not, we will revoke any such illegal transactions,&quot; she vowed. She said research was key to any development and all land in the county that had been set aside for such a project and grabbed must be surrendered voluntarily before her administration took over. Speaking at Kimbimbi market, the former Devolution Cabinet Secretary promised Mwea residents clean water and proper infrastructure. &quot;Most of the roads in the area are in a sorry state as a result of many years of neglect but my team is in the process of compiling a list that we will use to improve them,&quot; she said.
