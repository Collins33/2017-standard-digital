National Super Alliance (NASA) presidential candidate Raila Odinga has told members of Ameru community that he and other leaders of the outfit are what is required to move Kenya in the right direction economically. This comes as Mount Kenya Youth Caucus, a lobby campaigning for President Uhuru Kenyatta, castigated Raila for trying to divide the Ameru and Kikuyu for political expediency. Raila who started his tour of Meru County at Nkubu town in South Imenti and proceeded to Mikinduri in Tigania East on Saturday, told the local community to support NASA in its bid to &quot;rid Kenya of an ineffective Jubilee government&quot;. &quot;As NASA we want your support so that we can cross the River Jordan, on our way to Canaan,&quot; Raila told the crowd that turned out for the rally. He told residents of Tigania that he would fast track delayed road projects because the Jubilee government was not keen to complete projects to benefit locals. Raila said the Jubilee administration was riddled with corruption, something the NASA administration would eradicate.
