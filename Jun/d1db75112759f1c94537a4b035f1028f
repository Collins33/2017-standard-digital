Lamu MP Julius Ndegwa has been cleared by the electoral agency to defend his seat. Among his opponents is former nominated MP Betty Tett, who was cleared on Friday to vie on a Democratic Congress Party ticket. Mr Ndegwa will defend his seat on a Safina ticket after leaving the Kenya National Congress party on which he was elected in 2013. Nine aspirants have been cleared for the seat. The MP&rsquo;s clearance caught many by surprise as most of his competitors were confident he would not be on the ballot due to some outstanding court cases. Immediately after his confirmation at the Mwanaarafa Hall where the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission was receiving aspirants, hundreds of his supporters took to the streets of Lamu town with celebrations. Ndegwa told off his opponents who thought he would not be cleared, terming them cowards and asked them to get prepared for a tough battle.

Other aspirants include Anastasia Mwangi (Independent), Abdul Kassim (Jubilee), Stanley Muthama (Maendeleo Chap Chap) and Mary Nyaga (Narc Kenya).
