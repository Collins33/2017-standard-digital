Members of the Nairobi county assembly have extended their term in office for another two weeks. The MCAs agreed they were not only extending the life of the House to dispense of key business, but also because they were&nbsp;broke. More than 50 out of the 85 elected MCAs who had invested millions in their re-election bid lost in the recent party nominations held in the city. Extending the House means they will get access to allowances before they are sent packing. &quot;Since we came back from the nominations our pockets have been empty including yours Mr Speaker and we also have pending business so I support the extension of the assembly,&quot; said Majority leader Elias Otieno. Other members during the sitting lauded the Majority Leader, who is also the Kileleshwa Ward representative, saying they needed more time for committees to finalise on reports, bills and statements. Deputy speaker Ken Ngondi said the MCAs were looking to exit in an orderly fashion by making sure that they left the city better than they found it. &quot;We&#39;ve been in office for the past four years and we need more time to leave things in order,&quot; said Ngondi.
