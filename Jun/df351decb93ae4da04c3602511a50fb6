Deputy president William Ruto has come under sharp criticism from the opposition in his North rift backyard following his recent call to the electorate to use the six piece voting pattern in the August elections. The leaders also accused the DP for orchestrating the defeat of several leaders in Jubilee nominations who have now vowed to campaign against the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. This comes as aspirants contesting as independents and other political parties have resisted calls for a six-piece suit voting pattern as advocated by Jubilee Party and continued on a spirited hunt for support. Although residents assured them of solid support for the presidential vote, the JP top leadership however encountered some defiance in some regions where the electorate showed indications of making their own choices for candidates seeking other positions. Last week former jubilee stalwart leaders joined the opposition. They include; former Jubilee Party director and URP Chief Executive Officer (CEO) David Koech, Chesumei MP Elijah Lagat, former MPs Peris Simam (Eldoret South), Stephen Tarus (Emgwen), Jesse Maiz (Eldoret South), John Cheruiyot (Aldai) and &nbsp;former Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) director Judith Cheptoo Koskei.
