Jubilee Party now wants the cohesion agency to take stern action against National Super Alliance (NASA) flag-bearer Raila Odinga for allegedly issuing inflammatory remarks. JP through its secretary General Raphael Tuju has formally written a protest letter to the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC), to swing into action and bring Raila to book. Tuju who spoke at a press briefing in Nairobi played a video of the opposition leader uttering the alleged inciting remarks at function in Kajiado County to journalists, said its time NCIC cracked the whip on hate- mongers. In the video that has been doing rounds on social media, the Former Prime Minister is captured on tape camera addressing the public, where he is heard cautioning them against selling their land to unnamed people. &quot;With only 52 days to the national elections, we consider that Raila&#39;s use of irresponsible and inflammatory language will ignite tensions within local communities and can only be regarded as hate-speech,&quot; said the JP boss. Mr Tuju who was accompanied by nominated MP Johnson Sakaja emphasized that a few politicians should not be allowed to take the country to the dogs and asked Kenyans to speak up whenever they see leaders spewing hate-speech.
