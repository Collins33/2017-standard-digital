Al- Shabaab militants attacked and destroyed a Safaricom mast in Fafi area, Garissa County rendering the area inaccessible. The incident happened Wednesday night and the attackers are believed to have planted landmines on the route leading to the area. Police response to the site was slow out of fear of being affected by the Improvised Explosive Device that may have been planted there. North Eastern regional commissioner Mohamed Saleh said they had sent a team of police officers to the area to access the extent of damage caused. &quot;We understand there are criminals who destroyed a communication mast at Fafi Centre hence affecting various activities there. We are pursuing them,&quot; he said. He added police were pursuing the militants through alternative routes for fear of hidden IEDs.
