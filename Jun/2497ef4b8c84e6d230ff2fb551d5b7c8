Narc-Kenya leader Martha Karua has accused NASA leader Raila Odinga of hypocrisy in the ongoing debate on land ownership. &nbsp;Ms Karua claimed that in 2012 Raila and the then Lands Minister James Orengo visited Kajiado where the community land issue was raised. &quot;I recall Raila ordering Orengo to take up the matter immediately but the minister responded that since it was a weekend, the affected locals should bring their tittle deeds to his office the following week... the matter ended there.&quot; She said it was hypocrisy for Raila to go back to the same venue and make such wild claims on a matter Mr Orengo failed to address. She told Raila not to shift blame on Jubilee since he had all the instruments of power as Prime Minister to end historical injustices on the Maasai land.
