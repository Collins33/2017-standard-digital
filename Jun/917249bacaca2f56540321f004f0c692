Despite subsidy, maize flour still costs Turkana residents Sh180. Turkana residents are buying a 2kg packet of maize flour at Sh180 two weeks after the Government launched the subsidised one. The subsidised flour is retailing at Sh90 but it is not available in Turkana County. Wyclife Masinde, a resident, said: &ldquo;When you go to shops and supermarkets in Lodwar, flour still costs Sh180. This has made life difficult for many people here. We depend on food from Kitale and that means you buy everything, but having flour at Sh180 is too expensive.&rdquo; Janet Akiru, a vegetable vendor, has sought alternatives as she cannot afford maize flour.

Nowadays I prefer buying wheat flour to make chapatis as that is cheaper. My children miss ugali but they are slowly embracing chapati,&rdquo; she said. County trade director James Lokwale explained: &ldquo;Cases of hoarding, the scarcity of the commodity, and the high cost of transportation from Kitale are some of the reasons the prices are still high&rdquo;. Retailers caught selling the 2kg packet of subsidised maize flour above the recommended price risk a fine of Sh1 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.&nbsp;
