Some 11 people charged with vandalising the Standard Gauge Railway were yesterday given hefty bond terms. Mombasa Senior Resident Magistrate Lilian Lewa ordered each of the suspects to provide a Sh6 million bond and a surety of a similar amount or pay a Sh3 million cash bail each to secure freedom pending trial. On Friday last week, they were charged with economic sabotage and engaging in organised criminal activities. The court acknowledged that every Kenyan is entitled to bail pending hearing and determination of their cases. In her ruling, she also cited the amount of money used by the Government in the investment. Peterson Matunda, Benard Maina, Moses Wanyama, David Musyoki, Nicholas Muthuku and six others denied the charges before Ms Lewa.
