 Witnesses told The Standard that they were awoken by loud screams around midnight and when they came out, they saw huge flames and smoke at the homestead.
 When they reached the homestead, they saw one of the victims, Damiano Osuju, struggling to come out while still in flames. He however collapsed and died shortly thereafter.
 Area chief Samuel Onjiko said attempts to save the family were futile.
 They however managed to pull out the mother of the three alive and rushed her to hospital where she succumbed to her injuries.
 “I got a report after midnight that a family house was on fire and we rushed there, only to find the house had been razed,” said Mr Onjiko.
 Onjiko noted that they later found the bodies of the three children that had been burnt beyond recognition.
