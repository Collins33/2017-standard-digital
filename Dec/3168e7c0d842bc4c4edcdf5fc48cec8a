Two people have been admitted in an isolation ward at Mt Kenya Hospital Nyeri suspected of suffering from anthrax.
 The two were admitted on Saturday after they went to Nyeri County Referral Hospital suffering from skin blisters and swellings which medics suspected were signs of anthrax.

 County Health Executive, Rachel Kamau said doctors were yet to confirm if the patients were suffering from anthrax.
 “The patients had wounds consistent with the disease and this is why we have put them isolation as a precaution,” said Dr Kamau.

 She said samples collected from the patients had been sent for tests at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI).
 “Until it is confirmed we shall continue to keep the two patients under isolation, all medics attending to them will maintain rigorous medical protocols," she said.
