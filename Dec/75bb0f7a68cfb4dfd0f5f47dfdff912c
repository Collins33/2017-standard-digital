NTSA: Human error to blame for road carnage

 15. Sections in Kirinyaga 
 “In the past few days, we have experienced an increase in the number of fatal accidents. From December 1, 2017, we have tragically lost 150 lives across the country. On December 12, 2017, we lost 17 lives at Sachang’wan along the Nakuru-Eldoret highway. We are alarmed by this rise. A majority of these accidents have been attributed to human error and are preventable if all road users exercise caution,” said the statement.
 “We send heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their lives and wish quick recovery to the injured.”
 Preliminary investigations attribute the causes of these crashes to risk factors such as speeding, lane indiscipline, reckless driving, and driving under the influence of alcohol and other substances.
  “We appeal to all road users to play their rightful role in enhancing road safety by adhering to traffic rules and speaking out against reckless road use. Violations and complaints can be channelled to NTSA through the hotline 0718555999, National Police Service through toll-free numbers 999/911, or directly to the nearest police officer,” said the statement.
 NTSA and the police also urged all road users to exercise extra caution during the Christmas period, reminding the public that law breakers would be dealt with according to the law. 
 The stretch between Salgaa and Mau Summit has recently witnessed a significant number of crashes despite the interventions undertaken. 
 To enhance road safety along this particular section, the Kenya National Highways Authority is installing additional standard humps and rumble strips as a short-term measure. 
 The mid-term measures include a tender for the enhancement of road safety along the Kibunja–Salgaa section to be issued in a week’s time.
