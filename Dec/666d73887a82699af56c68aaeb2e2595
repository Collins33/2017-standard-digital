 The teacher went to Governor Okoth Obado seeking his employment letter.
 It was then that the job scam was exposed.
 The victim said he had been sending money to the former MCA's phone number.
 The former MCA would make him speak to a person he believed was Obado, only to realise much later he had been speaking with impostors.Â
