Former Jomvu Member of County Assembly Karisa Nzai has been sentenced to serve a 30-day civil jail at the Shimo la Tewa prison following failure to pay a Sh1.4 million debt.
 Mombasa Chief Magistrate Francis Kyambia said Nzai had failed to follow an order issued by the court to clear his outstanding debt.
 Nzai was arrested outside the court premises following a warrant of execution of a decree which had earlier been issued by the court on June 6, this year. Javaco Agencies Ltd had moved to court over theÂ non-payment of Sh1,464,255.
