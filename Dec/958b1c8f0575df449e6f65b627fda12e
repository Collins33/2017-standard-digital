A mother of six was raped and killed in Ol-Rongai village in Rongai sub-county.
 The woman was going home in the evening when she was attacked.
 Her husband, Jacob Kariuki, said she left for his in-laws' home at around 7.30pm on Saturday but did not reach her destination.
 Kariuki said he called his in-laws to ask his wife's whereabouts but she could neither be traced nor reached on her mobile phone.

 “She was was going to attend a ceremony at her ancestral home that was to be conducted on Sunday,” said Kariuki.
 He said members of the family and friends who were looking for her stumbled on her body near Ol-Rongai Primary School, about two kilometres away from their home.
 The naked body had multiple injuries on the head, hands, and legs. Kariuki urged police to speed up investigations and arrest his wife's killers.
