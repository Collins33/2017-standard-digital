The Middle East and Africa personal computing devices (PCD) market, which is made up of desktops, notebooks, workstations and tablets, declined 15.2 per cent year on year in the third quarter of 2017, according to the International Data Corporation.
 The global technology research and consulting firmâ€™s Quarterly PCD Tracker shows that shipments fell to around 5.9 million units for the period, which represents the lowest quarterly volume recorded during the last five years, led by poor performance of the tablet category.
