 OLX Country Manager Peter Ndiang’ui said buyers usually take advantage of end-year price slashes by dealers.
 “As we wrap up the year, the vehicle industry dynamics tend to change in most markets owing to the business targets to be met by the dealers. It is also during this period that discounts are offered, leading to an increase in cars being sold locally, both online and offline,” he said.
