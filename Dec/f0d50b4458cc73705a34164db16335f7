 Reports indicate the fire started at around 11pm in one of the timber houses and spread rapidly to adjacent nine rooms before it was put out.
 Nyeri Central Assistant County Commissioner John Marete said investigations were under way to establish the cause of the fire.

 "One child who is about five years old has died while two others are in hospital receiving treatment for smoke inhalation but they are in stable condition," Mr Marete said.
 However, it is likely that the fire could have been started by a candle or a kerosene lamp since the houses are not connected to electricity grid.
 The injured children were rushed to at Nyeri Provincial General Hospital. The fire was extinguished by residents who were working together with the county government fire engines.
 Nothing was salvaged from the affected houses.
