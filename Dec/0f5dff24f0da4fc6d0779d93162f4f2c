Three people were on Monday charged in a Runyenjes court with subjecting a girl to Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in Kigaa village, Embu East sub-county.
 They appeared before Senior Resident Magistrate Beatrice Kimemia and denied the charges.Â Mercy Wanjuki was charged that on December 2, 2017, at around 5am in Kigaa village, she illegally circumcised a 15-year-old girl.
 The girl's parents were charged with aiding Wanjuki in performing the outlawed rite of passage.
 The girl applied for court protection, saying her parents were cruel and would not be safe under their custody.

 She asked the court to be housed by her grandmother in Kavutiri village, who she described as supportive.
 The court granted her application and directed children officers to produce a report on the girl's needs by next Friday.
 The case will be heard on December 18.
