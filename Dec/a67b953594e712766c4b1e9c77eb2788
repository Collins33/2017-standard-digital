 After 38 days of crippled activities in public universities and hard lined negotiations, the Universities Academic Staff Union (UASU) has reached a ‘compromise’ and called off their strike.

 This is after UASU and Inter- Public Universities’ Councils’ Consultative Forum (IPUCCF) signed a Return to Work Formula to end the stalemate.
 The lecturers have been advocating for salary adjustments from the Sh10 billion deal negotiated under the 2013-2017 collective bargaining agreement.

 UASU Secretary General Constantine Wasonga said that all universities have agreed to fully implement the agreement unlike before when only five obliged.
 “All pending internal 2013-2017 collective bargaining agreements for individual universities will be completed by February 28, 2018,” he added.
 Vice chancellors of public universities had earlier maintained they are facing financial gaps that could not allow them to effect the new salary brackets.
 He would further add that negotiations for a 2017-2021 collective bargaining agreement are in the offing and meant to start on December 18, 2017 and end on February 28, 2018.
 In the return to work agreement, the government will also factor accruing pension contributions in the 2018-2019 budget and paid to the Retirement benefit schemes.
 Students who have been the major losers in the protracted strike will heave a sigh of relief as normal operations are set to resume immediately and teaching planned for Monday December 11.

 “In making some concessions, UASU balanced the plight of students and the fundamental rights of dons to dignified working conditions, collective bargaining and pensions,” said Constantine Wasonga.
