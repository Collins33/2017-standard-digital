Gatundu South Member of Parliament (MP) Moses Kuria has blasted Opposition leader, Raila Odinga, following his hardline stance that he will be sworn in on Jamhuri Day.

 He added that the former Prime Minister will commit treason and such an action shall be punished as the law stipulates.
 "The constitution is clear that you can't have two presidents. When you are sworn in, go home to your wife, not to State House. Being sworn in will mean you have committed treason and the punishment of treason is death by hanging. I tell Raila that Kenya is not his," stressed Kuria.
  
  
 The controversial legislator pointed out the NASA coalition should accept it lost in the election and move on with a development agenda.
