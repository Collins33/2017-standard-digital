Former Teso South MP Mary Emaase was yesterday dealt a blow as 12 of her petition witnesses were disqualified.
 Ms Emaase had lined up all the 12 in her case against the election of Geoffrey Omuse.

 The application by her lawyer, Evans Ondieki, to be granted authority to serve the respondents with affidavits by the witnesses was also dismissed.
 While disqualifying the witnesses, High Court judge Kiarie Waweru said the petitioner did not follow due process in filing the petition. Emaase is now the only witness in her case.

 Lawyer Ondieki failed to serve affidavits of the witness to the respondents after filing the petition to help Omuse and the electoral commission to prepare responses.
 Mr Omuse has lined up Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and himself as witnesses as he seeks to retain his victory.
 His lawyer, Joseph Makokha had objected to the application by Ondieki to serve them with affidavit long after the petition had been filed during pretrial proceedings. Justice Kiarie said it was total abuse of the court process.
