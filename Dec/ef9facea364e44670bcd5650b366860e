 “The shop is usually closed on Sundays, so we do not know what caused the blaze but firefighters managed to contain it," he said. 
 Military personnel joined in extinguishing the fire that engulfed the entire Armed Forces Canteen.
 Police said the case was being handled by the military police.
 Fire engines from the county were called in to help contain the fire. 
 Witnesses said the fire broke out at about 4pm and swept through the entire staff canteen destroying stocks of unknown value.
 This is the second time a fire has been reported inside a military installation in as many months.
