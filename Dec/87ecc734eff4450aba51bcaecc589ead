 In a special issue of the Kenya Gazette dated December 13, 2017, East African Affairs, Labour and Social Protection Cabinet Secretary Phyllis Kandie said Sossion and 10 other union officials were in violation of the provisions of Article 77 and 250 of the Constitution as they were State officers by way of nomination and election of Parliament.
 However, Sossion has defied the order calling it a government ploy to split and weaken the teachers’ union.
 Outgoing chairman Mudzo Nzili and his deputy Samson Kaguma are expected to give their farewell address during the three-day meeting after they were sent on leave pending retirement.
