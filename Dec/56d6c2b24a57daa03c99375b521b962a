  Muriithi was convicted by Nyeri Resident magistrate Nelly Kariuki.
 The prosecution led by Catherine Mwaniki said Muriithi stole and slaughtered the sheep worth Sh6,000 at his home in Ikumari village within Mweiga Kieni on December 11, 2017.

 The domestic animal was owned by Charles Kariuki Njuguna who is also the owner of the farm.
 The court heard that Muriithi committed the offence alongside his junior staff in that farm, James Mwangi, who escaped during arrest.
 They slaughtered the sheep at Muriithi’s residence and were preparing to feast on it the next day when police stormed.
 The prosecution, while reading out facts of the case to the court, said Mr Mwangi escaped with handcuffs on his hands but police are still pursuing him.
 The court heard that on the material day, the two employees returned the animals to the sheds as usual in the evening but the employer’s wife noted one sheep was missing.
 The woman notified Mr Njuguna who was in Nyeri town.

 The pieces of meat were produced in court as exhibit of the case.
 However, Muriithi asked for a non-custodial sentence saying he was the sole breadwinner of his family and was also taking care of two orphans.
 The magistrate ordered for a probation report before issuing the judgment in the case which was fixed to be mentioned on December 28, 2017.
 The court directed that Muriithi remains in police custody.
