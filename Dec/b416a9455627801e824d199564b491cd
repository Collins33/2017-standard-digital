 “We were told the complaint against Gachau was that he was homosexual and the issue had been raised in the church tribunal.We were told he had engaged in gay activities,” Mr Waithaka told the court.
 Waithaka said the letter implicating the priests was read to the congregation by the parish chairman, a Canon Ngunjiri in English, and later translated in Kikuyu language.
 While testifying before Lady Justice Abigail Mshila yesterday, the faithful drawn from St Andrews ACK Church Kagongo Parish in Othaya, claimed Gachau was ex-communicated through a letter signed by Bishop John Kagunda.
 The priests have accused Bishop Kagunda of maliciously and spitefully executing and authoring defamatory statements in church.
 They say the claims were repeatedly published in national newspapers, knowing well his allegations were not true.
 Monicah Njeri claimed the reputation of Gachau and his colleagues was tainted after being implicated in immoral activities.
