 The report contradicts earlier reports by Health Executive Hazel Koitaba, who placed the cholera deaths at two.
 Yesterday’s report was presented by Kibwana Baya, the chairman of the Committee on Health. He is also the Member of the County Assembly for Miritini Ward.

 The session was chaired by Deputy Speaker and Port Reitz MCA Fadhil Makarani.
 This followed a question by nominated member Moses Oindo on the status of cholera in the county.
 Ms Koitaba had reported that a mother and her child died and 25 people were admitted in hospital following the cholera outbreak.
 The report revealed the Department of Health had banned hawking of food and bottled water within the town and residential estates to contain cholera.
 Water bottlers
 "To rid the county of unscrupulous water bottlers, all companies in the sector are directed to immediately present themselves and deposit their Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) certification with the Department of Health, failure to which punitive action will be taken against them,” stated the report.
