 “Politicians must cease from preaching hate and animosity that will further divide Kenyans along political line,” said Okoth.
 He said many Kenyans suffered and innocent people died, calling upon those responsible to confess and reconcile with the affected families before they call for dialogue.
 “We must be challenged to reconcile with God and fellow mankind, it’s not an easy step but it’s a step of faith,” said Okoth.
 Catholic Vicar General of the archdiocese of Kisumu Fr Moses Omollo echoed bishop Okoth’s words adding that Kenya should not experience more deaths due to presidency.
 He appealed to residents not to be manipulated by politicians to turn against each other but should instead learn to embrace brotherhood.
  He said Christians should persist in praying and fighting for justice which comes with peace.

  He appealed to Christians to reflect on the birth of Christ as a symbol of peace and reconciliation.
