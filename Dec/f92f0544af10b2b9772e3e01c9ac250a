Chinese firms will beginning today showcase their products to potential Kenyan buyers at a three-day trade expo in Nairobi. 
 China Council for the Promotion of International Trade will host the China–Africa Industrial Capacity Exposition at Kenyatta International Convention Centre.
 Briefing journalists in Nairobi yesterday, the economic and commercial counsellor at the Chinese embassy, Guo Ce, said the expo would provide a platform for deepening of trade ties between Kenya and China.
 “The expos will provide a platform for large and medium-sized Chinese corporations looking for new opportunities in Africa and in return participants will have an opportunity to network,” said Mr Ce.
