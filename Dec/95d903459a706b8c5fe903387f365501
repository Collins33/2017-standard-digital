  Four are held at the Central Bank of Kenya and 27 with commercial banks. The committee had sought to know the status and need for some of the accounts, with some dating back to the defunct city council.
 Governor Mike Sonko yesterday said his administration was looking into the accounts and would close those that were deemed unnecessary. “We are looking into the accounts and we are only going to retain the necessary ones and close the others,” he stated.
