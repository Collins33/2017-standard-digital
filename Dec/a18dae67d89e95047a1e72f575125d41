The National Super Alliance (NASA) has written to eleven Governors requesting for venue for Raila Odinga swearing in that is scheduled for December 12.
 “Your county having passed the People’s Assembly motion, the presidential inauguration team is requesting your office to provide a venue for this high level event in your county,” read part of the letters.

 The letters addressed Governors Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Anyang’ Nyong’o (Kisumu), Cyprian Awiti(Homa Bay), Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni), Okoth Obado (Migori), Wycliffe Oparanya(Kakamega), Wilber Ottichilo (Vihiga), Amason Kingi (Kilifi), Odeke Ojaamong(Busia), Charity Ngilu (Kitui), Cornel Rasanga(Siaya) whose counties have passed the People’s Assembly motion.
 Raila’s party has refused to acknowledge Uhuru Kenyatta as the duly elected President of the Republic of Kenya. NASA is said to have reportedly insisted that any form of dialogue with Jubilee must entail electoral reforms with a view to laying a roadmap for another election, a position President Uhuru has dismissed.

 On Friday, the Opposition unveiled a seven-member committee to guide the coalition on the way forward of the People's Assembly.
 The team is chaired by economist David Ndii and will be responsible for coordinating programmes of all county assemblies that have so far formed the People’s Assemblies.
 The Ndii team is expected to hand over its report to the NASA principals before Jamhuri Day, a day Raila has announced he will be 'sworn in' as the people's president.
 The committee will also provide a list of activities for December 12 when the coalition plans to swear in Raila.
