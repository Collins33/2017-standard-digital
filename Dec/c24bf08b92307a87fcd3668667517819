 Among the dead were nine family members who were travelling to Vihiga from Kitale after attending an unspecified ceremony.
 On Tuesday, over 30 people died and scores injured in an accident involving Modern Coast bus and 13 other vehicles at Sachagwan along the same highway.
 The accident happened after a truck driver, who was being chased by NTSA, lost control of the vehicle and hit oncoming vehicles, Modern Coast Bus, four Nissan matatus, a truck and several other private vehicles resulting to the deaths.
 National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) chief said plans are underway to construct a dual carriageway at Sachang’wan as part of the solution to the current problem.
 “We are considering a dual carriageway to ensure that those vehicles driving down do not use the same road as those travelling up,” he said.
 As NTSA ponders what to do in order to fix the problem on our roads, careless driving and human errors have been blamed on the increasing number of roads accidents.
