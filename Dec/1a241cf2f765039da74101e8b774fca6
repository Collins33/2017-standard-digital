Governor Samuel Tunai has accused senior county officials of authorising construction of illegal stalls on road reserves and in Narok Town centre.
 He said he would also take disciplinary action against implicated officials, including sacking.

 Tunai also lamented that a lot of public land has been grabbed and vowed to repossess it.
 Tunai accused corrupt county staff of leasing space to unsuspecting traders leading to mushrooming of kiosks, especially in the town center.

 The county government had already demolished hundreds of structures illegally constructed in an ongoing operation.
 “We love our traders and we respect them. But the law must also be followed. We are going to stop at nothing to ensure all public land is recovered. We shall demolish any structure erected in public land,” said Tunai.
 He added: "We are investigating the matter and any county official found to have unlawfully authorised the illegal structures will be sacked and prosecuted."
 The governor directed newly-appointed Lands Executive Julius Tompo to carry out an audit of public land to establish how much of it has been grabbed.
 "We will set up a team that will evict anyone occupying grabbed public land."
