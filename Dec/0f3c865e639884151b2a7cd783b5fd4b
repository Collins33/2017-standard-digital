Embakasi East MP Babu Owino will be investigated for allegedly breaching the code of conduct of MPs following an alleged fist fight with his Starehe counterpart Charles Njagua.
 Benard Momanyi has petitioned the House to investigate the MP for various offences. Mr Momanyi contends that Rule 7 of the code of conduct for MPs provides that an MP shall uphold the dignity and integrity of the House by promoting respect for the House and its institutions at all times.

 Momanyi also argued that Rule 8 of the same code provides that a member of the House shall treat other members with respect and strive to have cordial relations with his colleagues.
 On Thursday, House Speaker Justin Muturi directed the Powers and Privileges Committee to investigate the claim and present a report to the House within 60 days.
