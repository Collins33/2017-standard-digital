 According to a worker who declined to be named for fear of reprisal by the contractor, the particular section was weak following rains in the area in the past weeks.
 The worker narrated how they heard a loud bang followed by screams and dust as the section caved in and buried the workers.
 “They were six and we managed to retrieve four who were rushed to hospital but the other two had died before we could rescue them,” he said.
 The worker said they did not have helmets and other protective gear while working on the culvert hence the fatalities.
 “Had the contractor provided safety gear, the lives would have been saved. We challenge the Government to direct them to provide the same to us,” he said.
 Mai Mahiu OCS Ezra Sambu confirmed the incident adding that plans were underway to transfer the injured workers to Kijabe Mission Hospital.
