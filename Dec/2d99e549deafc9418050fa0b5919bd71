Jamii Telecom has become the fourth mobile phone operator after it launched its Faiba 4G network that is expected to increase competition in the industry.
 The firm will focus on mobile internet, which is increasingly becoming the staple for the established players and has seen their earnings from traditional services such as voice stagnate or grow marginally.
 Jamii also unveiled its mobile data packages, which were priced lower than those of the three other operators. For Sh1,000, subscribers to the new network will get 25GB of data valid for 30 days.
 This is in comparison to the 3GB that Safaricom customers get for a similar amount, Airtel (6GB), and Telkom Kenya (4GB). Faiba 4G Mobile will offer free calls within the network and Sh2 per minute for offnet calls.

 Popular for its Faiba brand that offers internet connection mostly to corporates, Jamii said it had rolled out its 4G network in Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, and Eldoret, with plans to increase network coverage to the rest of the country in three years.
 “We are in plans to increase the coverage. At the moment we have 300 base stations, which will go up to 600 in the course of next year and increase to 900 in three years,” said Chief Executive Joshua Chepkwony.
