 Much has been said about the treacherous 14-kilometre stretch of road between Salgaa and Sachangwan that has become the most notorious black spot in Kenya.
 Hardly a week goes by before a grisly accident is reported. The latest case involves six musicians and the driver of the ill-fated saloon car in which they perished on Saturday night.

 Despite public outcry and the identification of possible causes of accidents in this area, relevant authorities, particularly the Government, have done nothing besides sending messages of condolences, berating drivers and waiting for the next accident to happen. That baffles. Every once in a while, the National Transport and Safety Authority gives us statistics, but the question is; for how much longer will human life continue to be a mere statistic when a lot can be done? Factors that lead to accidents, like driver apathy, fatigue, missing road signage, drink driving and corruption are well known. These are issues that be dealt with conclusively, but there appears to be a lack of goodwill.
 The Salgaa-Sachangwan road is narrow, yet the traffic is heavy and mixed. Visibility on this stretch is limited and the steep inclines do not aid safety. While strict enforcement of traffic regulations will eliminate most of the human errors, it is necessary at this point to rethink the design of the road.

 Several speed bumps could provide a short-term solution, but the construction of a dual carriageway may prove to be the solution we have all been waiting for.
