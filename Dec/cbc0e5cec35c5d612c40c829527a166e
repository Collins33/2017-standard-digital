 The Chinese don urged governments and other agencies involved in the fight against the scourge to adopt a multipronged approach in the war against the killer disease through use of both conventional and Chinese herbal medicine.
 In a message to mark the World AIDS Day 2017, the researcher says as the world races towards the fulfillment of eliminating the disease by 2030, this year’s theme of my health, my right, should be followed to the letter through embracing both conventional and herbal medicines.
 The Professor says that a combination of herbal and conventional medicine has helped China significantly reduce spread of the HIV virus in that country.
 He said that the Tian Immunity Booster-TIB, which controls the multiplication of the HIV virus in humans had proved very effective to most TIB users globally.
 “This combination of herbal and conventional has helped China significantly reduce spread of the virus and so it is the time for developing nations, especially in Africa to embrace this strategy to help in the reduction of the disease in the continent, “says Prof.Tian Shengxun.
 He says discovery of the drug was part of the contribution by the Chinese University towards global efforts to find the elusive anti-retroviral therapy, and ensuring access to lifesaving medicine to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030 as set out by the United Nations.

 Studies conducted on TIB by Dr. Josef Schneider at Freiburg University (Germany) and a similar study by Dr Peter Nara of Biological Mimetics Inc in Maryland State (USA) , particularly medical scientist in Tokyo Japan reveal the TIB drug can inhibit the HIV replication as the Fusion Inhibitor.
 “Findings from our research shows that those patients who have used TIB as alternative HIV/AIDS therapy can survive for more than 15 or 20 years,‘’ reconfirmed Prof. Tian.
 TIB is manufactured through modern technology as proper compounds extracted from more than 30 different pure Chinese herbs. For sure TIB therapy has multiple functions and can handle most of Opportunistic Infections (OPIs) linked to lower immunity or HIV/AIDS.
