Ugandan woman to serve 20 years in jail for acid attack on rival

 Sometimes your other half is genuinely completely out of line. Other times they're just breathing too loudly.
 One argument which is a seriously bad sign, however, is when one person in the relationship resents the other's success.

 Worryingly, this is what one woman recently witnessed first-hand between a couple at an airport.
 The woman from California heard a man tell his girlfriend that she shouldn't take a work promotion as he would be "humiliated" if she earned more than him.
 The man in question then allegedly told his partner there was little point in focusing on her career as when they were married with kids that she wouldn't be working anyway.
 Livid, the girlfriend responded by throwing her boarding pass at him before storming off and telling him to "have a nice time in Cancun."
 The onlooker continued: "SHE JUST RAGE QUIT. OMG PEOPLE CLAPPED WHEN SHE WALKED AWAY. BEST. DAY. EVER."
 And she had an important message for the "airport lady."
