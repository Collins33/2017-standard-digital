Detectives yesterday detained a pastor in connection with the rape of two women at Vipingo sisal plantation in Kilifi County last week.
 Kilifi Directorate of Criminal Investigations Officer Christopher Chesoli said the man was picked up after the public spotted the vehicle believed to have been used when one of the women was abused.

 The driver sped away but they caught up with him in Mnarani,” said Mr Chesoli yesterday.
 The DCIO said the owner of the car was identified but he told police he had rented it to the pastor.
 The DCIO said in one of the attacks, the pastor picked up his victim at the Kilifi bus stage, posing as a driver for a private care hire firm.
 “He poses as a driver for a private car and always asks for passengers going directly to Mombasa. But on the day he picked up the lady, he branched into a sisal farm, raped the woman, and robbed her of money,” he said.
 To call home
 Before dumping the victim, he asked her to call home and claim that she had been kidnapped, said the DCIO.
