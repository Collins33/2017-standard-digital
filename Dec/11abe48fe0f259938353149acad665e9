The hearing of case challenging Governor Alfred Mutua’s win in the August 8 General Election will resume on January 8, 2017 after Justice Aggrey Muchelule adjourned the proceedings on Friday.

 County Returning Officer, Joyce Wamalwa, who took the witness stand for cross examination maintained the gubernatorial elections were free and fair, and that the results declared were ‘a true reflection of the will of the Machakos electorate.’

 Ms Wamalwa also denied claims by the petitioner, former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti that there were massive illegalities and irregularities in the election, insisting the entire exercise was conducted in accordance with the Constitution.
 “The results I declared at the county tallying center were the same ones I received from the various constituency tallying centers as submitted by respective returning officers,” she said.

 Ms Wamalwa, who was listed as the second respondent in the petition also maintained there were no discrepancies in the final tally of votes with regard to the figures transmitted electronically and those recorded on form 37 As.
 The development comes at a time when city lawyer, Mugambi Laichena has petitioned the Chief Justice David Maraga to investigate Ham Lagat advocate, who allegedly swore two conflicting affidavits relating to the ongoing petition.
