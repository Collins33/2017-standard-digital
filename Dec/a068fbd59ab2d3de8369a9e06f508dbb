Liberia's National Elections Commission has set December 26 as the date for the presidential runoff vote.
 The second-round vote between former soccer star George Weah and Vice President Joseph Boakai had been on hold after the Liberty Party alleged first-round voting irregularities. The Supreme Court last week cleared the way for the runoff, saying there was not enough evidence to support the allegations.

 Commission chairperson Jerome Korkoya on Tuesday pleaded for all registered voters to go to the polls the day after Christmas to "make this one sacrifice for the good of our democracy and country."
 The runoff date was announced after the Supreme Court last Thursday ordered the commission to proceed with the vote after it was delayed for a month by fraud complaints.

 The vote is seen as a crucial test of Liberia's stability after back-to-back civil wars between 1989 and 2003 and an Ebola crisis that killed thousands from 2014 to 2016.
 Voters are choosing a successor to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first female leader and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
