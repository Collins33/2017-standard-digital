 Mr Khitamy said the event that will run from December 11 to December 16 is organised to celebrate the birth of Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam.
 Lamu, a Unesco World Heritage Centre, is one of the oldest towns on the East African coast and among the first in the region to embrace Islam. It also has some of the oldest mosques and centres of islamic learning in the world. Studies have established that Islam reached Lamu before many parts of the Persian Gulf, Middle East, and Asia.

  “Maulid is a highly regarded holy celebration usually,” said Khitamy.
