 The decision which he says is informed by many students missing out on college education due to lack of school fees will see only parents registered as voters in the county benefit from the program.
 
“As promised in my campaign manifesto, my government will pay school fees for all Machakos students who wish to pursue post-secondary higher education and skill training,” said Governor Mutua.

As part of requirement, Mutua wants applicants to be admitted to a recognised, accredited institutions or are already enrolled and studying in a recognised institution.
 Other requirements include being a resident of Machakos and parents of applicant being registered voter in the county.
 He said the money will come from the county coffers, donors and philanthropists.
 "If our monthly wage bill is Sh400 million, what is  Sh400m in a year?" he wondered.
 As for students on the Higher Educations Loans Board dole, he said the county will ionly chip in to assist those whose are not fully funded adding that vetting will be rigorous to eliminate non-derserving cases.
