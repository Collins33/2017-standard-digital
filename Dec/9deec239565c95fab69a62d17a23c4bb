 “I know that the president spoke with Rupert Murdoch earlier today, congratulated him on the deal and thinks that, to use one of the president’s favorite words, that this could be a great thing for jobs and certainly looks forward to and hoping to see a lot more of those,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters.
 The deal is likely to face an antitrust review by the Department of Justice, which is run by a Trump appointee.

 Trump often praises Fox News, the conservative cable news channel that has given him favorable coverage and is also owned by Murdoch but not included in the sale.
 Trump has been less enthusiastic about mergers of companies that own news outlets of which he has been critical.
 The president objected to the proposed AT&T Inc (T.N) and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) merger, which is currently being litigated after the Justice Department sued to block the deal. Time Warner owns cable news network CNN, which Trump frequently says reports “fake news.”
 Trump was also scathing of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) while the government was reviewing its acquisition of Whole Foods, a deal that was ultimately approved. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, which Trump has criticized.
