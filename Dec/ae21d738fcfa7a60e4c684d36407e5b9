The State has set aside 200 acres for the construction of a public university in Endebess Sub-county.
 A lobby group in the county has now called on area governor Patrick Khaemba to set aside funds to jump-start the project that they said would improve education standards in the county.
 Addressing the press in Kitale yesterday, Kenya Parents Association (KPA) County Chairperson Wellington Waliaula lauded the move.
 Mr Waliaula said that parents would cut costs by sending their children to a nearby university.

 "As parents of this county, we want the governor to allocate funds for the construction of the facility," he said.
 "The project is going to open up our county to more investors for those who want to provide hostel services and further help parents cut cost as their children will not be forced to travel long distances when we have same facilities near our homes."
 Quality education
 Governor Khaemba said his administration had already put in place measures to jump-start the project.
 “The issue of quality of education has been paramount in my administration and that is the reason we decided to request the national government to allocate land to the county government,” he said.
 During his recent visit to the county, Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett said the ministry had already transferred the land to the county government for the development of infrastructure.
 He urged the county to fence off the land to secure it from intruders.
 Mr Khaemba last year opposed the elevation of Kitale National Polytechnic to a university, an idea that was being fronted by Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa.
 “We have been given land and the construction of a local university will commence soon,” Mr Khaemba said.
