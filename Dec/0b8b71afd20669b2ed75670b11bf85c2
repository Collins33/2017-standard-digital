Two of former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe’s key allies have fled to Kenya with their families, according to Zimbabwe media.
 Kenyan authorities are yet to confirm reports of the foreigners’ alleged presence in the country amid claims in Zimbabwe media that Jonathan Moyo, who was allied to Mugabe’s wife Grace, has waged a Twitter campaign against President Emmerson Mnagangwa's new government.

 Moyo and Saviour Kasukuwere fled to Kenya after the Zimbabwe Defence Forces seized the capital, Harare and parts of the country, according to media reports that indicate that the two left the South African nation in the wake of Mugabe’s detention by the military on November 14.
 Moyo, a controversial character even within the Zanu PF, from which he was ostracised, belongs in the G40 cabal that the new administration and military has branded as criminals for plundering the economy.

 Kasukuwere was local government minister whereas Moyo served as Cabinet minister and spokesman.
 The G40 group includes military and intelligence officers, politicians and businessmen allied to the Zanu PF youth wing.
 Yesterday News24 reported on its online edition that Moyo and Kasukuwere are, most likely hiding in Kenya and indicated that while Grace is believed to be in Zimbabwe, her children are scattered in Singapore and South Africa. “Grace’s allies Moyo and Kasukuwere, who sought refuge at Mugabe’s house, the Blue Roof after the army intervention, have also left the country."
 Meanwhile, The Herald of Zimbabwe reported yesterday that former Zimbabwe Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko, who is also among the G40 group, has been forced to leave Botswana by Gaborone authorities and return to Zimbabwe.
