A sombre mood engulfed Akongolone village of Igembe Central in Meru County on Monday during a requiem mass for four herders killed by bandits on December 10.
 The four – Mutharimi Kathiori, Muriki Gichunge, Kimunga Kariti and Edward Muriki – were grazing their cattle when bandits believed to be from the neighbouring Isiolo County ambushed and shot them dead.

 Akirang'ondu Ward MCA Richard Gitaari said it was unfortunate that people were losing their lives due to strained relations over pasture.
 "We are calling on the two county governments to see to it that communities here coexisitng," he said.
 He said the visiting herders had also scared away farmers from their farms for fear of being attacked.
 Mr Baariu M'Limungi, a resident, said the county and the national governments should liaise to ensure more police officers are posted at Akongolone AP camp to boost security.
 He said they would be forced to take the law into their hands if the Government fails to act.
