Four ODM lawmakers have warned the Government against plans to stop remitting devolved funds to counties whose assemblies passed the People’s Assembly Bill.
 Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga, MPs Samwel Atandi (Alego Usonga), Lillian Gogo (Rangwe), and Walter Owino (Awendo), claimed the Jubilee administration was planning to stop giving funds to counties for passing the Bill.

 “There are plans by the Jubilee administration to sideline some counties in resources allocation because they passed the Bill. But we will not allow this to happen,” said Gladys Wanga.
 Wanga maintained that as NASA legislators, they will not relent on the fight for electoral justice.

 Atandi argued that residents of such counties will suffer from lack of essential services from their county governments if the funds are not remitted.
 He said all Kenyans have a right to receive funds and resources from the National Government since all citizens pay taxes equally.
 “All Kenyans pay taxes equally hence it would amount to mistreatment if residents of any county fail to receive government services because their county is denied funds,” said Atandi.
 National Super Alliance-allied counties passed the People’s Assembly Bill to provide forums for advocating electoral reforms in the country.
 The legislators were speaking during a fundraiser to build classrooms at Ondiche Primary School in Rangwe Constituency.
