The county assembly's bid to debate and approve or reject nominees to the county executive committee flopped on Tuesday over MCAs' lateness.
 Speaker Emmanuel Situma complained about the delay by the MCAs to appear in the chambers for a special sitting.

 "Due to their coming in late and the bulkiness of the report, we will need more time to debate it and the members will receive both hard and soft copies. This house is now adjourned," he declared. The MCAs arrived in the chambers around 3.15pm, about 45 minutes late. The bell announcing the start of the session rang at 2.30pm.
 Unconfirmed reports indicated the lawmakers could have been angered by Governor Wycliffe Wangamati's aides.

 Mukuyuni MCA Meshack Simiyu said they would not tolerate insults from the aides.
 Mr Simiyu said Mr Wangamati's aides should desist from trying to interfere with the working of the assembly as they had a right to meet the governor.
 "We will not tolerate insults from those close to the governor. One officer cannot be the one causing disunity in the county. We want him to go and that is final," he said.
 His Kimaeti counterpart Jack Wambulwa said it was wrong for an officer to taint the names of elected officials in public and called for the officials to be reprimanded. "It is very wrong for someone to hurl abuses to MCAs. Action must be taken against him," he said.
