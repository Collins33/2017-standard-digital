Naivasha continued to live up to its billing as the 'second Coast' as it attracted tens of revellers from various parts of the country.
 Despite the harsh economic times, hotels and recreational facilities recorded impressive turnout as families made merry.
 The political impasse created after the last General Election was blamed for the drop in the numbers of international visitors around the lakeside town.
 Â Despite the challenges, revellers were optimistic next year would be much better as they called for tolerance and respect for the law.

 Lake Naivasha Hotel Owners Association Chairman Peter Mehta said 90 per cent of visitors were local tourists while the rest were from neighbouring towns.
 Mehta, also Crayfish Hotel chief executive, noted the repeat presidential polls had adversely affected their international bookings.
