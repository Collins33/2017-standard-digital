 The Deputy President said treatment of cancer was still a major challenge in the country that needed concerted efforts to contain it. 
 “To minimise cases of cancer, we have to make sure that the necessary health infrastructure is put in place to contain increasing cases of the disease in the country,” said Ruto. 
 “This is why we intend to come up with legislation in Parliament to cater for people in dire need of health services including cancer through NHIF,” added Ruto. 
 The Deputy President said the Government was putting in place mechanisms to increase the number of people covered by NHIF from the current 6.7million to 30 million in the next five years. 
 Speaking during the requiem mass of the late Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze at the Christ Is the Answer Ministries (CITAM) in Karen, Nairobi, on Friday; Mr Ruto said the Government would work towards the attainment of the universal health coverage.
