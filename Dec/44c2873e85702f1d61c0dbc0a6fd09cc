KISUMU, KENYA: Kisumu County Government has banned operation of commercial toilets at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital (JOOTRH).
 The ban came after a public outrage following claims that patients were being charged Sh10 per visit in order to relieve themselves in the facility toilets.

 County Executive for Health Dr Roseline Obara on Monday sent a memo to the region’s main referral facility, directing that such business be put to a stop.
 “This office has been notified of a toilet in your hospital where members of the public are charged Sh10. This matter has caused numerous complaints. In this regard, you are hereby advised to stop the charges immediately,” read the memo in part.

 Last week, the social media was abuzz with criticism of the facility in what the residents claimed was a syndicate to rob patients.
 A video footage had leaked of an old man begging for Sh10 from bystanders in order to be allowed to use the toilets, after those manning them denied him entry if he failed to raise the money.
 According to the critics, the guards have been harassing unsuspecting hospital users; a situation which they claimed could lead people to relieving themselves in the compound for lack of the toilet fee.
