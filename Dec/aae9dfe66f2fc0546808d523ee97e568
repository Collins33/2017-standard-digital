 KCPE candidates
 Matiang’i announced that all the KCPE candidates who scored 400 marks and above - 498,775 boys and 494,943 girls - will get slots in national schools.
 The CS said each candidate will be placed on merit regardless of whether they sat the examinations in public or private schools.
 There are about 105 national schools. The focus will, however, be on the traditional national schools that have dominated performance in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination in the past.
 The selection team allocates slots based on a computer programme that uses merit as the main criterion.
