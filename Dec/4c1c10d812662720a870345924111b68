 Instead, they were driven in unmarked cars to an out of town hotel near the National Intelligence Services Headquarters off Thika Road where they spent the night.

 She said the four had undergone medical examination and found to be in good health.

 “It has been a very long journey to get here and it is very unfortunate that we fell into this,” said Ravi Ghaghda who spoke on behalf of the four.
 He disclosed that a “huge” delegation from Kenya had visited South Sudan President Salva Kiir for negotiations that culminated in the parole.
