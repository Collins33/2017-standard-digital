Former Vice President and Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka is expected back in the country this week to a packed diary.
 The National Super Alliance (NASA) principal has been attending to his wife, Pauline, in Germany since August, which has kept him away from the political scene.

Dialogue the only option, says Raila

 Kalonzo is likely to miss the burial of his close ally the late Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze tomorrow.
 The Wiper Party leader might also not be able to attend his son, Kennedy Musyoka’s swearing-in at the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) in Arusha today.

 Kalonzo will be faced with growing discontent within his Wiper Party over nominations for House roles, especially the battle for a slot in the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC).
 Speaker Justin Muturi ruled that he would wait for a communication from Kalonzo on the party's nominee.
 Kalonzo will also jet back amid plans to swear in Raila Odinga and himself as people’s President and Deputy President.
