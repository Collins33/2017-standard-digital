 Ahead of girls
 Though there was a significant drop in the number of candidates who scored A- this year compared to last year, boys still raced ahead of girls. There were twice as many boys who scored A- compared to girls. A total of 1,813 boys scored A- compared to 901 girls.
 The trend seems to be maintained in the other top grades as 4,596 boys score B+ compared to 2,748 girls. Grade B was shared by 7,738 boys and 4,890 girls, while 11,631 boys scored grade B- compared to 7,754 girls.
 C+ grades
 Boys still led girls in the number of  C+ grades, posting 15,828 against girls' 12,032. The trend is replicated in all the other grades.
 More girls scored A grades this year compared to last year. In 2016, out of the 141 As, girls got 58 while boys got 83.
 Overall, there is no statistic to back the narrative that girls performed better than boys in the examination.

 Although girls performed better than boys in six of the subjects offered, boys performed better in 23 of the subjects.
 Girls did better than boys in English, Kiswahili, CRE, home science, art, and design and electricity.
 Overall performance
 Although the Education Ministry argued that this year's performance was better than last year's, a closer look at the results shows that 70 per cent of the candidates scored mean grade D and below.
 This was a drop from the 65 per cent last year. A total of 438,914 candidates scored D and below compared to about 376,414 last year. 
 The number of candidates who qualified for university this year fell by 18,000 compared to last year. The data shows that the number of those who qualified shrunk by 21 per cent to 70,073 compared to 88,929 who made the cut in 2016.
 The drop is expected to generate concern among private universities, which will have a smaller pool to pick from next year after public universities admit the bulk of the candidates who score C+ and above.
 County performance
 The data shows that only 18 counties had a candidate in the top 100 positions. This means that 29 counties did not have a candidate among the top best-performing students.
