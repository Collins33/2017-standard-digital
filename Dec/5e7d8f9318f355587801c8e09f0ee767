NAIROBI, KENYA: Why wouldn’t the management of the Kenya Railway Corporation and the Standard Gauge Railway put up requisite signage directing travelers to its station in Syokimau? 
 Two concerned Kenyans on Wednesday complained to Grapevine that they almost missed the SGR passenger train after they lost their way to the station.

 There is no signboard along the busy highway indicating the route where travelers can access the station, posing a challenge to people heading to the facility for the first time.
 And while still at it, cant the management ‘decentralize’ the issuing of tickets to their Nairobi offices and make it easier for   travelers ?
