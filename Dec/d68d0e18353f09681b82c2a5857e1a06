 “On the fateful day, he went out with my son only to bring him back with serious injuries.
 She said two months ago, the suspect poured hot water on the minor leaving him with serious injuries.

 Burns on his stomach and chest are yet to heal completely.
 “We are doing our best to ensure the boy is stable. We hope he will be discharged in a week’s time,” Dr Oreng’a said.
 Local children’s officer Pilot Khaemba condemned the incident and urged locals to report any incidents of child abuse.
