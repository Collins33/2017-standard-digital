Kirinyaga Senator Charles Kibiru has asked a court to dismiss an application seeking recount of votes.
 Mr Kibiru told Justice Abigael Mshila that the petitioner, Daniel Karaba, did not clearly demonstrate why a recount should be carried out in the entire county, yet he had stated in his application that he had issues with results from two constituencies.

 Through his lawyer Elisha Ongoya, Kibiru dismissed Mr Karaba's evidence as hearsay after admitting he did not have any Jubilee appointed agents in all the polling stations during the August 8 elections.
 “The petitioner has brought tabulated results before this court of the votes he allegedly garnered on polling day whose sources were his handpicked ‘agents’ who neither had a letter of appointment from his party (Jubilee), nor an oath of secrecy letter which were to be produced to a Presiding Officer,” Ongoya submitted.
