South African President Jacob Zuma has lost two court cases in one day, both linked to corruption allegations.
 Pretoria's High Court ordered Mr Zuma to set up a judicial inquiry, calling him "seriously reckless" for challenging recommendations by a watchdog in a case against him.

 The party is currently battling to choose Mr Zuma's successor as leader. He is due to remain as president until elections in 2019.
 In his 10-year term he has been dogged by allegations of corruption, all of which he denies.
 In the first ruling, the court gave Mr Zuma 30 days to appoint an inquiry into allegations of corruption against him and his associates.
 The inquiry was one of the recommendations on state influence-peddling by the country's anti-corruption watchdog, which the president had tried to challenge.
 Judge President Dunstan Mlambo described Mr Zuma's attempt to challenge the rulings as "ill-advised" and an abuse of the judicial process.
 As yet,Mr Zuma has not commented on the decision.
