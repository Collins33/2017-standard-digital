 The buses will travel to Kakamega, Bungoma, Kisii, Eldoret, Kitale, Kisumu, Siaya, Nanyuki and Meru, while those from Mombasa will travel by Madaraka Express.

 The fans also got an opportunity to interact with different Radio Maisha talk show hosts and presenters.
 The flag-off ceremony took place earlier on Friday morning at the Standard Group headquarters in Nairobi.
 This is an effort to celebrate the festive season with fellow Kenyans. Radio Maisha is a branch station under the Standard Media Group.
