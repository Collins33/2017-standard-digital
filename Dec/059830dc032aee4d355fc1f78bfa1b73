 Police found two women preparing the brew. Area OCPD Peter Muchemi said the officers seized 600 litres of unpacked brew, 20 crates of packed liquor, 50 crates of empty bottles, and thousands of bottle tops. He said the two women were arrested and taken to Runyenjes Police Station and would be arraigned in court after investigations are concluded.
 The women were packing the brew in bottles bearing the sticker of a popular drink to pass it off as a genuine brand.

 “The public tipped us off that an authorised liquor distributor was counterfeiting known brands. He is using a legal business to distribute illegal liquor. We raided his premises but he was not in. We are hunting him,” said Mr Muchemi.
 The fake currency that was seized was in thousand shilling notes and was in the final stages of production.
