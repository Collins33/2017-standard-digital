The Kenya Revenue Authority boss has said he will not ask for a renewal of his term.
 Commissioner General John Njiraini said he will exit KRA at the expiry of his current contract, on March 3, next year.

 He has argued in court papers that he cannot be compelled to take terminal leave pending his retirement and should be allowed to be in office until the last day of his contract.
 “According to the instrument (contract) I signed with KRA, it expressly provided my engagement with KRA for a period of three years commencing March 4, 2015 and that period is set to expire on March 3, 2018,” he said.

 “Contrary to the claims in the petition, I have not sought an extension of my contract as commissioner general of the KRA beyond the stipulated expiry date and reiterate that my appointment to the said office is well founded in the Act.”
 Njiraini’s response is contained in a replying affidavit filed in court through lawyer Waweru Gatonye, dated December 5, 2017.
 This is in response to a case filed before Justice Maureen Onyango by activist Okiya Omtatah, who is seeking orders to compel KRA to send Njiraini on terminal leave.
 Njiraini has been at the helm of KRA since March 2012, when President Uhuru Kenyatta, then Finance minister, appointed him.
