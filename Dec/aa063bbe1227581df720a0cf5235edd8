The Nairobi County government will for the first time pay its workers from internally collected revenue without depending on funds from the national government, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said.
 This was after Governor Mike Sonko complained of delays in release of revenue meant to pay workers’ salaries.

 Speaking during the launch of the Nairobi County Data Centre, President Kenyatta lauded the Sonko-led administration for sealing loopholes in revenue collection, terming the action laudable. He also promised to see to it that the National Treasury releases the workers’ salaries on time.
 “Workers have been going for Christmas without their pay but this time round they will receive their salaries before. Nairobi will for the first time pay its workers without relying on the national government and that is the development we want,” Uhuru said.
