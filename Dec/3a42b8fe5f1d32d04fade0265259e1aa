 Power connection
 “The Government’s power connection initiative will help learning institutions in the utilisation of technology and tech resources,” he said.
 He said in areas that were not reached by the national grid, the authority would use solar power as a source of lighting for schools and health centres.
 Gicharu declared the school electrification project a “great success”. He assured Kenyans that the electrification project was almost complete.

 “(Some) 99.5 per cent of schools that were initially identified for connection to power have been electrified and the remaining five per cent are new institutions that have come up recently,” he said, adding that going forward the authority would be connecting schools on a continuous basis.
 He said rural electrification remained a priority of the Government noting that REA was determined to provide electricity to every household in Kenya.
