 “We lie in one of Indian Ocean’s best fishing grounds. But our fishermen are ill-equipped and lack necessary gear to traverse ocean waters to catch fish,” he said.

 The fishing industry in Lamu, Godana said, had a net worth of Sh1 billion a year with production standing at 2,700 metric tonnes.
 “Fishing in Lamu supports more than 75 per cent of the county’s economy directly and indirectly,” said Godana.
