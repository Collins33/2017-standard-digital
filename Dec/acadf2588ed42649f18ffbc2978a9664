 The Head of State said the NHIF enrollment is part of the President’s Big Four growth agenda, which targets affordable healthcare for all, food security, housing and manufacturing.  
 President Kenyatta also directed Matiangi to work with Attorney General Githu Muigai to make presentations to the DPP so that cases of cheating involving more than 700 teachers countrywide are expedited.

 The President also asked the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to reward principals, schools and subject teachers who excelled to promote continued high performance. But similarly, President Kenyatta said teachers caught cheating should be punished severely to serve as an example to others.
 CS Matiang’i said the results are showing a normal curve as reforms in the exam system are entrenched.
 President Kenyatta directed CS Matiang’i and the head of the Kenya National Examination Council (KNEC), Prof. George Magoha, to institutionalise the reforms so that the achievement made in the last few years is maintained.
