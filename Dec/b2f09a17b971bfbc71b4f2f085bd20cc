 The pair are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court, in central London.
 This comes a day after a security review said it was "conceivable" that the Manchester Arena bombing in May, in which 22 people were killed, could have been prevented.
 But MI5 Chief Andrew Parker told Mrs May and the Cabinet on Tuesday that about nine alleged Islamist terror plots have been foiled since March.
