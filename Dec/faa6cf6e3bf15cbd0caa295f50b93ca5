Two initiates who had undergone a month-long rite of passage at Torokiat village in Narok South sub-county went missingÂ on Monday while on a hunting challenge.
 The two boys, who had undergone circumcision on November 11 after the closure of schools, are said to have disappeared at around 5am, prompting shocked villagers to launch a frantic search.
 According to Alexander Tonui, a father of one of the boys, the initiates aged 17 and 18 had gone hunting in the bushes when they went missing, a day to their pass out ceremony.
