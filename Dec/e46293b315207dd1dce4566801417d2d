 Differences between the two candidates
 Mr Ramaphosa, 65, has spoken out strongly against state corruption and has the backing of the business community.
 He campaigned as the anti-Zuma candidate, promising to target corruption, and his victory could mean that the ANC decides to recall Mr Zuma as national president in the next few weeks.
 The Supreme Court ruled in October that Mr Zuma should face corruption, fraud, racketeering and money-laundering charges.
 The ANC recalled Mr Zuma's predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, in 2008 after Mr Zuma replaced him as ANC leader the previous year.
 Ms Dlamini Zuma, 68, had been critical of the enduring power of white-owned businesses and had pledged to tackle what she said was continued racial inequality.
 Analysts said that Mr Zuma had backed his former wife.
 The ANC election came amid declining support for the party, though opinion polls still suggest backing of about 50 per cent.Â 
 There was a touching moment when Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma came on stage and hugged the man who beat her, by less than 200 votes to the top job in the party, and put a halt to her ambition to be South Africa's first female president.
