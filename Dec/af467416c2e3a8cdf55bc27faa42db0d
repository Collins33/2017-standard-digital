The drop in government revenue as revealed by the National Treasury is not a surprise. The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) collections show the tax man missed the target by a whopping Sh30 billion. The ambitious target set for the first quarter was Sh89.6 billion.
 The Treasury said the drop is due to the subsidies given by the Government on maize, milk and sugar imports to cushion millions of ordinary Kenyans against rising inflation. However, much of the deficit came from a significant drop in Pay As You Earn tax, which declined by Sh17 billion from the previous period. This is a direct indication that many jobs were lost in the period since July.
