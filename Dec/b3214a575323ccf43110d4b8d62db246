The controversy over the order to small-scale traders to flatten their temporary structures in major towns has deepened after Governor Cornel Rasanga threatened to sack the officials planning the demolition.
 Mr Rasanga yesterday argued that it was unfair to give traders a 14-day notice to demolish their structures without giving them an option where to do their business.

 Speaking in Segere village, Alego Usonga, the governor said he had sent his officials to investigate who authorised the construction of the temporary structures in the town and not to give a notice of demolition as purported.
 “Having realised that there were very many temporary unplanned structures in the town, I sent my officials to confirm who was authorising their construction. Instead of investigating what I sent them to  do, they  opted to give a demolition notice to traders,” said Rasanga.

 He maintained that he would investigate the individuals who have been giving orders to small-scale traders to put up temporary unplanned structures.
 “Those temporary structures are not part of the town planning but if anyone has used their money to construct then nobody has the authority to demolish them without giving an alternative. I told my officials that they must have a place for the traders before demolition,” added Rasanga.
