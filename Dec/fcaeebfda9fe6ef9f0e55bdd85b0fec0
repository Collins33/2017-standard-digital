 “Our officers were on patrol when they stopped the Probox but the driver instead sped off forcing the officers to give chase. It was upon searching the vehicle when they discovered the illicit brew branded Samba Waragi,” said Ole Kine.
 Ole Kine said the brew from Uganda was suspected to have been destined to bars in Kitale adding that a crackdown has been mounted against the sale of the illegal liquor.
 “We cannot allow unscrupulous business people to make quick money by selling illegal liquor. We are conducting an operation to weed out such alcohol,” said Ole Kine.
 He further said investigations were going on before the two suspects are arraigned in court.
 The Uganda brew packed in sachets is sold in the County cheaply and attracts its high supply. Some dishonest businessmen are making good money from its sale.
 Last month, over 2,000 litres of illicit liquor was impounded in Eldoret town in the county of Uasin Gishu.
