University cancels Linturi’s law degree

 The senator had gone to court seeking orders to compel the University of Nairobi to allow him to graduate as a lawyer, pending the hearing and determination of the suit.
 Justice George Odunga declined to issue the temporary order on grounds that Linturi had not convinced the court that he would suffer irreparable damage if he does not graduate tomorrow.

 The judge directed the matter to be heard on February 20.
 Lintuli moved to court last week seeking to be re-admitted to the University of Nairobi as its student.
 He claims that he was to graduate tomorrow with bachelor of law degree.
 Through lawyer Tom Ojienda, Lintuli claims that on November 30, 2017, just 21 days to his confirmed graduation, while watching TV news, he learnt with shock, dismay and consternation that he had been allegedly deregistered as a student of the University of Nairobi for allegedly having a fake degree.
 The lawyer wants the court to quash the decision dated November 30, 2017, by the University of Nairobi to de-register Lintuli.
 The senator wanted the court to compel the University of Nairobi to reinstate his name in the graduation list for December 22, 2017.
