 “He was a development-oriented leader who saw the initiation of several water projects and schools. As a family and church we have lost a servant,” said Meru County Assembly Speaker Joseph Kaberia.
 Governor Kiraitu Murungi asked mourners and the church to keep the dream of the priest alive and pledged to complete some projects that he had initiated.

 “We should not allow Fr Mbiko’s dreams to die. As the governor l will ensure that Meru people get water which had also been his priority. As the county we will also support grape farming, create markets for the products, and expand the winery which is mostly adored by the Catholic Church in Meru,” Kiraitu said. 
 During his 33 years in priesthood, Fr Mbiko initiated 17 water projects and helped build schools and Consolata hospital in Nkubu town. He also opened the Diocese of Meru Centenary Sacco.
