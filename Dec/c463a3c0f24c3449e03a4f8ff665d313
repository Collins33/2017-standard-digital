 This accident comes hours after one claimed the lives of three African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa (AIPCA) bishops in Mwea, Kirinyaga County.
 The saloon car in which the bishops were traveling in was involved in a head-on coalition with another as it tried to overtake near the Wamumu Approved School on the Nairobi- Meru highway.
 National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) has come sharp criticism for doing little to stop the incessant road accidents.
 On December 27, 2017, NTSA officials had to flee from the scene of an accident in Matuu town after a crowd of angry of people charged at them. They were accused of laxity in dealing with the carelessness an impunity that cost most lives.
 On the fateful day, a 52-seater bus licensed to operate under a Githurai-based Sacco overturned killing five.
 A statement from the road safety authority would however absolve its officers of the accusations arguing they had relocated to a different place to carry out another operation.
