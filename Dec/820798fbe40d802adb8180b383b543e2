Lands Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi has announced changes in land registration procedures.
 In a legal notice, the CS announced the scrapping of land registration districts, which will now be replaced under 61 land registration units spread out across the country.

 The new units are expected to come into force any time from now. The new order, which effectively revokes the 1981 Registered Land Districts Order, lays out the procedure for the conversion of parcels of land from the current system of registration to the newly established land registration units.
 The order also details the procedure to be followed by any person with an interest in land within the registration units who is aggrieved by the information given in the conversion list.

 Open for dealings
 “In accordance with the new order, the authority responsible for land survey, which is the Surveys Records Office shall prepare cadastral maps and conversion lists indicating the new and where applicable old numbers for parcels of land within each registration unit. Upon completion of this exercise, the authority shall then submit the cadastral maps and conversion lists to the registrar of lands,” explained Jacqueline Wangui of MMC Africa Law.
 The CS for Lands will thereafter be required to publish through the media the cadastral maps and conversion lists and set a date from when land registries shall be open to the public for dealings relating to parcels within the registration units.
 He will also be required to send a copy of the publication to the relevant county governments for further dissemination to the public.
