 "We saw electricity sparks from one of the shops and what followed was an uncontrollable fire outbreak that burnt several shops, "said Mr Oloo.
 Confirming the incident Siaya Deputy County Commissioner Joseph Sawe said they were yet established the exact value of the property destroyed.
  Mr Sawe noted that they were yet to conduct an evaluation,which could only happen once the shop owners record statements.
 "We cannot tell the exact cause of the fire. It can only be established after thorough investigations, which have already commenced," he added.
 The DCC admitted that there was a delay from the fire fighters who arrived at the scene very late claiming that the fire engine was in Bondo at the time the incident broke.
 "The delay led to a failed rescue mission. It is also sad that several business people lost more through looting from members of the public. I arrived at the scene earlier but sadly several people were looting property from shops but claimed they were contain the fire, " added the DCC.
