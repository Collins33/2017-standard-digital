Anti-stock theft police officers on a recovery mission in Chepalungu were yesterday forced to fire in the air to disperse a rowdy mob.
 The officers, who were tracing two cows allegedly stolen in Trans Mara, were met with resistance from public when they found one of the animals at Chebunyo.

 Chepalungu OCPD Patrick Musyimi said the mob threatened to lynch the officers who wanted to arrest a suspect found with one of the stolen cows. The officers called for reinforcement from Chebunyo.
 It is suspected cattle rustlers hide stolen cattle from the neighbouring Narok County in Chepalungu forest.

  Locals have, however, denied any link to theft of livestock, saying unknown criminals were behind the incident. Mr Musyimi asked locals to cooperate with security personnel to net the criminals.
 “My appeal is that locals should alert the security personnel whenever these criminals are trying to hide stolen animals within their locality,” said the OCPD.
 Lately, several cows have been stolen along the border of Trans Mara and Chepalungu. The menace of cattle theft between the two constituencies is rampant.
