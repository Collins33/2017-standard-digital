Vice Chair Delegated Legislation in the National Assembly Fatuma Gedi has said that they will soon begin their work as a committee to clear backlog.
 The Wajir Woman Representative said there were 28 pieces of law that had been passed and needed regulations to operationalise them.
 “Our committee has its work cut out, our hands are full and we will hit the road running even before the end of the year, a number of pieces of laws passed need to be implemented and we must set their regulations,” said Ms Fatuma.
 She also said that among the regulations they are supposed to set on the laws passed are procedure rules for the Competition tribunal, active service punishment and the execution of sentence of death for the Kenya Defence Force.
