 According to Philip Etale, the law breaches the Constitution and propagates divisive politics.

 Ward reps said the law was passed to create employment for the local people.
 Majority Leader Antony Ikonya said the move was in line with Article 65 (1) (e) of the County Government Act.
 “I note with a lot of concern that Kiambu County has been generous … very generous to people who are from outside this county, to an extent that we do this at the expense of our very own.
 “For people who come from outside, we provide infrastructure for them, we do roads, provide water for them and do all the requisite responsibilities of a county government for them but, as a county, we don’t benefit.  I think it is time we cured that disease,” Mr Ikonya said.
