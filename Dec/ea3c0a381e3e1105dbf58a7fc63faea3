 Differences between Rwanda and Burundi over seats is already derailing assembly.
 According to former Ugandan Speaker, when he adjourned the house, Rwanda was to occupy the seat next after Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
 However, Burundi is claiming the seat on grounds she signed the East African Community (EAC) treaty on the same day with Rwanda in 2007.
 "Burundi was to get the slot next. An alphabetical order puts her ahead of Rwanda," said Kenyan representative Simon Mbugua to the regional assembly.
 Kenya has remained neutral.
 The matter has been referred to the Summit, EAC's top decision making organ, chaired by Ugandan leader Yoweri Museveni.
