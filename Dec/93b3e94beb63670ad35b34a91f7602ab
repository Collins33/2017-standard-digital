Kenya is among 40 countries elected to the highest decision-making body on maritime issues globally. 
 From next year, Kenya will be a council member of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), a position it will hold for two years.
 The development comes at a time when the country has started showing renewed vigour in exploiting the blue economy through deep sea fishing in a bid to tap the Sh200 billion industry. Of the three categories A, B, and C, Kenya has been elected under the third category, which has 20 other member states.
 Other African nations in this category are Liberia, South Africa, Morocco, and Egypt. Internationally, there are Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico, Malta, and Turkey. Category C comprises countries that have a special interest in maritime transport or navigation.

 “Kenya’s election to the council will ensure representation of all major geographical areas in the world,” said IMO in a statement.
  Kenya boasts a coastline of 1,420 kilometres. IMO is currently meeting in London.
