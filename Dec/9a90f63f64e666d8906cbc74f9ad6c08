Taita Taveta University has been closed indefinitely as the ongoing lecturer’s strike continues to further cripple public varsities.
 The decision was arrived at after a special Senate meeting on September 24 and November 29 which reviewed the status of teaching and learning and resolved to close the varsity indefinitely.

State to pay lecturers Sh5.2 billion

 In a Memo from the Registrar Academic, Research and Outreach, the students have been asked to vacate the school premises latest by Friday December 1, 2017 as new semester dates will be communicated later.
 This is as learning was expected to resume this week after the Government authorised the release of Sh5.2 billion to pay the striking workers.

 Lecturers across all public universities have since November 1, 2017 been on strike protesting the Government’s failure to honour a 2013-2017 Comprehensive Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
 Earlier reports had indicated that the payment of the monies was to be split in two phases, the first Sh2.1 billion to cater for the accrued salaries in the last five months and the balance to be paid latter. A move that has faced great opposition from the striking lecturers as they hold on to their hard line stand insisting the amount has to be paid in full.
