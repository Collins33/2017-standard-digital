Taxi-hailing firm Uber has added an app feature that allows drivers to reject or accept long trip requests.
 The latest feature seeks a driver’s consent before the company links them to a rider taking a long trip. Uber defines a long trip as a journey taking between 45 minutes and an hour.

 “The 45-60 minutes is based on the expected time to arrive at the rider’s destination. Of course, there will be times when unexpected traffic or a change in the rider’s destination means that the trip could take longer,” said Uber’s East Africa spokesperson, Janet Kemboi.
 According to Ms Kemboi, this new feature allows drivers to plan their lives better by giving them more information that helps them make decisions that are right for them because while there are some drivers who are not able to accept long trips, there are even more who prefer them.
