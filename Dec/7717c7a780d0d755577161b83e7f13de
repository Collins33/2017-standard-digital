 “We will not allow leaders who have imposed themselves on the people to continue destroying this nation,” Raila told supporters in Kakamega town on Sunday.
 The Opposition chief, who earlier attended the Cecafa opening football match between Kenya and Rwanda at Bukhungu Stadium, claimed Jubilee Party had threatened the Judiciary and manipulated the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to favour them (Jubilee).
 Not relent
 Raila, who was accompanied by Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, said NASA would not relent in pushing for reforms in the country.
 He claimed at least 215 NASA supporters had been killed by police since the August 8 elections.
 “When I returned from the US, 18 people were killed by police. We buried some of them over the weekend,” he said, adding they would take Uhuru head on until he relinquished power.
