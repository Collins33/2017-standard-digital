Nearly two weeks after she was raped by six men in a horrific eight-hour ordeal, a 17-year-old girl has yet to get justice, with her attackers still at large.
 The area’s Nyumba Kumi initiative leaders accused the police of laxity in apprehending the suspects whom they said are well known in Ahero town.
 The Class Seven pupil, an orphan, identified two of her attackers.
 Yesterday, the Nyando sub-county Nyumba Kumi initiative chairman, Hezekiah Omanga, told The Standard that even though the rapists vacated the house where they attacked the girl, they were still being seen roaming in Ahero town.

 “We have told the police to apprehend the suspects but so far nothing has been done,” said Mr Omanga. The police, however, denied the claims, saying investigations were underway and that they have mounted a search for the suspects.
 Ahero OCPD Mohammed Amin said officers had arrested one suspect.
 A guardian of the orphan said the girl was still complaining of stomachache and was not sleeping well.
 “We are just hoping that her attackers will be brought to book,” she said.
 Turned away
 After the attack, the teenager was turned away by a sub-county hospital because she could not raise Sh30 for a card.
 The girl was abducted by two men on a motorcycle who took her to a house in a deserted compound in Ahero where four other men joined in her rape.
 The men ordered her to wash away the blood stains on their clothes.
 They later blindfolded her and led her out of the house and abandoned her in an open field.
