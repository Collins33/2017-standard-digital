Local leaders have petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta for inclusion in new Government appointments.
 Area MP Gitonga Murugara yesterday said Uhuru should consider appointing persons from Tharaka Constituency to the Cabinet as a reward for the region's loyalty.

 "Tharaka has been a bedrock of Uhuru's support. We plead with Uhuru to remember us as he shares out the national cake. We have people like Prof Mzalendo Kibunjia, ( Director General of National Museums of Kenya), Prof Geoffrey MuceeÂ  Rukunja (Chief Principal, Meru National Polytechnic) or even Prof Erastus Njoka (Vice Chancellor, Chuka University)," he said.
 According to the MP, the constituency has never produced a Cabinet minister since independence.

 "It is only during Uhuru's time that we have witnessed some measure of development. For the first time we are witnessing the tarmacking of Marimanti-Gatunga road through the lobbying of Senator Kithure Kindiki," he said.
 Murugara, who was elected on a Democratic Party ticket in August 8 polls, pledged support for the Jubilee government.
