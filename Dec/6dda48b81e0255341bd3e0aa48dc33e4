Two families in Kisumu are mourning the deaths of their children who drowned in River Kibos on Sunday.
 The two - four-year-old Clifford Ochieng and Lawrence Owuor, 7 - went missing after leaving their houses to go and play together.

 They failed to return home that evening, prompting their families to search for them. Yesterday, a child found their clothes on the river bank and raised the alarm.
 After several hours of searching, divers found the two bodies. Atieno Otieno, a relative of Owuor's, said the two bodies were huddled together.
