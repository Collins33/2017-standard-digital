An MCA has moved a motion seeking to have boda boda riders wear tags with their names and photos in an effort to streamline the sector.
 Ruguru Ngandori MCA Sammy Muturi said on Sunday riders would also be required to register with associations or saccos that would vet them to weed out criminals. 
 "The motion will also require the county to provide riders with a lawyer in case they are arrested in the course of their work," he said. 
 "This is also intended to weed out rogue elements who have invaded the sector."
