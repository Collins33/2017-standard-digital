 No permit or licence
 "The factory manufactures about five brands illegally. It has no permit or licence for it operations. Whatever we have found here does not meet the standards of a distillery," said Mr Kipkemoi.
 The official added that the plant posed health risks to the consumers of the alcohol.
 "This is actually a great loss to the Government in terms of raising revenue and at the same time the health issues since no standards have been enforced. The legal manufacturers are also incurring losses because the illegal liquor is sold with bottles bearing their stickers, " Kipkemoi said.
