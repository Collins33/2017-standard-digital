There is likely to be a drawn out dispute between Jubilee and its four defiant MPs the court reinstated to various House committees after they were removed by the ruling party.
 In response to a High Court order temporarily blocking the National Assembly from de-whipping the legislators, the party said it was within its powers to determine its members to House committees. National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale yesterday said the party would explore all options to block the MPs from assuming the leadership of the committees to ensure regional balance.

MPs to elect House committee leaders

 Jubilee Party had drawn up a list of its representatives to various House committees, only for MPs Kangogo Bowen (Marakwet East), Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills), Silas Tiren (Moiben), and James Mwangi (Embakasi North) to defy and defeat the members endorsed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.
 The MPs sued Majority Chief Whip Benjamin Washiali, Duale, and the Speaker of the National Assembly to challenge the party's decision to remove them from the teams despite their winning of the leadership positions through a vote by members.

 â€œThe determination of whether to discharge a member from a committee lies only with the party that sponsored a member to Parliament," said Duale.
