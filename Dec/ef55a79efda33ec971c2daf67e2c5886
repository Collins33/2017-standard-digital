Over 500 elderly farmers have been issued with title deeds after more than 40 years of waiting.
 The farmers said they bought the 811-acre farm from the family of the late Nyandarua North MP Josiah Mwangi (JM Kariuki) 41 years ago, under Wikaro Kanyamwi Farm.

 The group then agreed to subdivide the land as they waited for the processing of title deeds.
 According to the farm’s chairman, Peter Mwangi, some unscrupulous traders conspired with former directors to sell the land, resulting in a case that lasted more than four decades.

 Most of the original members of the group have since died. Those that remained could not hide their joy when they were finally issued with title deeds in a colourful ceremony at Gitare village, about 20 kilometres from Gilgil town.
 “We have been taken in circles for years, we thank God that this process is finally over,” Mwangi said.
