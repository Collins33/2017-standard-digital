Police officers have been directed to contribute Sh1,000 each for the construction of a girls’ school supposed to admit students whose parents work in the force.
 The money, amounting to Sh90 million according to an internal memo, will be used to construct two classes, a dormitory, kitchen and administration block for the proposed Utumishi Girls which will be next to the boys school in Gilgil.

 Utumishi Boys opened its doors in 1992. It was also constructed through similar contributions and a plan to construct Utumishi Hospital has never taken off 10 years after it was mooted.
 Bitter

 The idea to construct a girls’ school was discussed during the Form One selection for Utumishi Boys at Vigilance House.
 “Members in attendance agreed that this was a noble idea which needed to be realised soonest,” says the memo signed by Moses Kikulu on behalf of the Commandant Anti Stock Theft Unit. It was sent yesterday.
 “They agreed that every serving officer will contribute Sh1,000. The money shall be contributed through check-off system at source at the rate of Sh100 per month,” reads the memo.
 While it appears to be a noble idea, some officers, especially those in the low ranks are bitter that the girls’ school just like the current Utumishi Boys will be a preserve of the senior officers’ children. Some say the force should have instead asked for the money from Government.
 “Nobody has consulted us and since it is going to be a Government school, the money should come from the Government,” said one officer.
 Kenya has at least 90,000 police officers which means some Sh90 million will be raised from this initiative.
