 "Those who wanted dialogue like NASA can now come for it instead of resisting because we now have President Kenyatta in power.
 "There was no way everyone was going to win elections and those who lost must accept and move on. NASA has tried all ways which have not worked. Let them back Uhuru," said Mandago.
