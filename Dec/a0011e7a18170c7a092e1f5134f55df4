 They were short-listed from a total of 1700 applications for the research grants.
 This emerged during the National Research Fund (NRF) strategic plan launch in Nairobi. Master's students will receive Sh500, 000 each while PhD researchers will receive Sh2 million.

 Acting NRF Chief Executive Officer Jemima Onsare said the research funds covered three areas: Postgraduate category (master's and PhD), multidisciplinary and multi-institutional category and the infrastructure category.
 Under the multidisciplinary and multi-institutional category, researchers were awarded for cross-cutting projects for a period of three years. The allocation for this category per project is Sh20 million.
 Only 20 universities were lucky to be awarded the infrastructure money that targeted improvement of research equipment.
 Education CS Fred Matiang'i said NRF would continue to stimulate research through targeted funding.
