Companies and institutions in the county will be required to employ 70 per cent of local people following a motion passed in the assembly.
 According to the motion which was passed unanimously by ward reps, companies that defy the law risk being denied licences to operate in the county.

 Constitutional provisions

 Mr Ikonya said many companies and institutions in the county had breached the constitutional provisions in respect to having 70 per cent of jobs given to the dominant ethnic communities and reserve 30 per cent to non-dominant groups.
 The MCA said as a result, Kiambu residents have continued to suffer due to unemployment while many companies continued to outsource labour.
 Ndeiya MCA Gideon Gachara, who seconded the motion, said with the new law and with the standard gauge railway works being done in his ward, area residents stand to benefit from the jobs available.
 “The people we represent stood by us and we must stand by them. They should always come first,” said Mr Gachara.
 Gitothua ward representative Daniel Kaberi said it was sad that one of the biggest housing projects in Kenya - Tatu City in Ruiru - employed only a few local residents.
 Nominated MCA Emma Wanjiku said many companies in counties were sidelining women by denying them jobs.
