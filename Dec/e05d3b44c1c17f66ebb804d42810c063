 A 'sensitive media' prompt will be shown to users before they can opt to view it. But such content will no longer be allowed on a person’s profile page and users will be asked to remove it. Repeat violators will be banned.
 The company said the move would “reduce the amount of abusive behaviour and hateful conduct” on the network. A spokeswoman confirmed that profiles would be removed.
