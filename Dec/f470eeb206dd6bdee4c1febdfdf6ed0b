 “I was walking on Nandi Street and noticed the officers dragging a man and woman and forcing them into their van. Suddenly, one of them pounced on me, and called his colleagues who dragged me into their van and drove me to the cells,” Kangogo said.
 Mr Kangogo was detained for over an hour. He identified himself as a journalist but the officers could hear none of it.

 The officers refused to release him saying he had obstructed them from performing their duties.
 It took the intervention of journalists who stormed the resident Magistrate’s Court cells to have him released.
