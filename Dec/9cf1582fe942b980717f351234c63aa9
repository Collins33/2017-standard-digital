 She put on notice contractors undertaking the works to ensure quality work, warning that those who will not meet the expectations would be blacklisted.
 The governor said ECDE projects started by the previous regime that were yet to be completed would also be considered by her administration.
 Laboso said she had given priority to ECDE centres to encourage good foundation for pupils starting their education.
 She, at the same time, appealed for support from the education players to be able to take the county forward.
 Barchok called for collaboration by sector players and parents, noting the works started by the county would not succeed without their support.Â
