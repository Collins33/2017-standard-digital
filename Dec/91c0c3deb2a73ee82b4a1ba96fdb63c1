 Sarite said the hardest hit areas were Garba-Tula, Merti, Oldonyiro and parts of Isiolo Central, including estates in Isiolo Town.
 He attributed the crisis to consumption of contaminated and untreated water, especially in the remote areas where locals rely on boreholes, wells and river for water.

 Sarite added: "But it is important to note that all hospitals, health centres and dispensaries have adequate drugs in their stores to take care of the patients. We have also dispatched chlorine and other chemicals to treat water in the affected areas."
 Affected centres
 "Public health and water officers have also been deployed to the affected centres to disinfect water tanks."
 Isiolo Water and Sewerage Company has also been directed to treat its reservoir. The official confirmed the outbreak of diarrhoea had affected several estates in the town.
 "Those who have been affected should seek treatment in any Government health facility as soon as possible. We have enough drugs and personnel to attend to you," said Sarite.
 Meanwhile, the official asked residents to observe hygiene standards and boil water before drinking.

 "There are a lot of mosquitoes in the region. I therefore urge residents to clear all the bushes around their houses as well as stagnant water to stop their breeding and sleep in treated mosquito nets.
