 There were no deaths at the scene of the accident.
 The seriously injured passengers were rushed by ambulances belonging Kericho County government and Red Cross rushed to Kericho District Hospital for treatment.
 Three of the accident victims who were in critical condition suffered broken limbs and other soft body tissue injuries.
 By 8:30pm, rescuers were still trying to free one of the passengers who was still trapped in the mangled wreckage of the bus which overturned on impact.
 Matatu Owners Association Chairman Simeon Kimutai who was one of the first responders, blamed the accident on the bus driver being unfamiliar with the road.
 “The bus ordinary operates a city route and the driver wasn’t familiar with the Kericho-Kisumu Highway. This is the reason Public Services Vehicles should not be allowed to take routes other than those they were licenced to ply,” he said.
