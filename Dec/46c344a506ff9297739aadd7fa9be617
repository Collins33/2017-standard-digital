 Mr Wakahiu asked the Directorate of Criminal Investigation and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate the matter.
 The magistrate vowed the court would not be influenced by any politician in its rulings.

 “It has come to the attention of this court that some parties in some of the petitions I am handling have been sending emissaries to try and seek favours from this court,” said Wakahiu.  
 “This court takes this opportunity to warn such parties to desist from such behaviour. Do not even think about it, the court will determine all cases before it based on merit and without fear or favour,” he added.
 He said the court would not bow to pressure to give favourable rulings. 
 “The court takes the matter seriously and investigative agencies should move with speed and investigate the claims and bring the suspects to book," he said.
