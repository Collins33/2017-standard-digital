Governor Lee Kinyanjui’s nine nominees to the positions of Chief Officer will have to wait until January 8 to be vetted.
 The Employment and Labour Relations Court sitting in Nairobi yesterday extended orders to stop the vetting process after listening to preliminary objections raised by the county assembly.

 The assembly through its lawyers raised the objection, saying the process was ongoing and should be allowed to go on because all positions of Chief Officer had not been filled.
 Last week, the court issued the orders following an application by nominated senator Victor Prengei, who stopped the vetting citing violation of some constitutional provisions. Mr Kinyanjui had submitted before the assembly the list of names to fill the nine positions of Chief Officer.
