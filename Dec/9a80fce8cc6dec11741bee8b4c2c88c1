 It took fire engines, which reported to the scene soon after, more than an hour to put out the fire at the Department of Defence (DoD).
 Property of unknown value was destroyed in the fire although the losses were lessened as the fire was contained before it could spread to adjacent structures.

 Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) spokesman David Obonyo confirmed there were no casualties during the dawn incident.
 Col Obonyo said the fire could have been caused by an electric fault even though investigators were still trying to establish the cause.
 “We are yet to establish the cause of the inferno but we suspect an electric fault. We have launched investigations into the matter,” he said. 
 Both the police and military officials are investigating the incident.
 A source said they were still assessing the damage to establish the value of destroyed property.
 Elsewhere, several structures were destroyed in a fire in Kangemi on Sunday night.
