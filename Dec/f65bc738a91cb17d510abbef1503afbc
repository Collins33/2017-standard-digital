It is a matter of concern that we have yet to see an end to the spectacle of lectures’ strikes that have had a negative impact on the economy and students, who take a longer time to complete their courses when such disruptions occur. Unfortunately, students who were expected to sit their final exams this December will have to wait until a later date.
