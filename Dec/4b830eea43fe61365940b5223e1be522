Parents in the county have been told to stop hiding their disabled children.
 Rockefeller Okeyo, the county chairman of Persons Living With Disability Forum, said hiding such a child was tantamount to violation of human rights.
 Speaking in Homa Bay town, Mr Okeyo called on parents to give children equal freedom of interaction. He said keeping children away from the public had denied a number of them access to education.
