 A nephew of the accused, Patrick Kamau, who was 16 at that time, testified before Resident Judge Mary Kasango that on the fateful day as he was preparing to go to school, he saw the children heading to the dam together with their mother.
 The court heard the bodies were discovered by James Njuguna, Ms Wamaithaâ€™s brother, when he went to the dam.

 Later both residents and the police arrived at the scene.
 Previous conviction
 Wamaitha, who also had a previous conviction for escaping from lawful custody, was arrested and escorted to Kinamba police station.
 She had earlier denied the allegations but confessed during the hearing that she drowned the children, arguing they hindered her from getting married.
 Justice Kasango found Wamaitha guilty, and Mwangi Kariuki, who was representing her, did not mitigate for the accused for the offense had only one sentence.
 "The offense is cruel and heartless because it denied the children the right to grow and be persons they were intended to be because of a selfish desire to get married," said Justice Kasango in her judgement.
