 According to court records, Njuguna committed the crime on March 9, 2012, during a school trip.
 “The accused asked the complainant  to sit on his lap while they were traveling in a 14-seater matatu. He later asked her to turn around and face him before he unzipped his trouser and soiled the minor’s dress,” read the statement.
 School uniform
 According to the Nakuru resident magistrate, the child in her statement said her teacher urinated on her clothes when he asked her to sit on his lap facing him.
 But test results from the Government Chemist which were presented before the court identified the substance from the child's uniform as seminal fluid from the accused.
 Njuguna was, however, acquitted of the main charge of attempted defilement after the court cited lack of evidence and proof of intent.
