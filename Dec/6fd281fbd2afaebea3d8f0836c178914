 Some of the children rescued from the streets will be sent back to their homes.
 Julius Yator, the county coordinator of Children Services, said the operation was prompted by the rising number of street children in Eldoret town, a trend that has elicited public concern.
 Nick Omito,  director of Eldoret Human Rights and Mitigation Centre, lauded the operation noting it was humane.
