I do not fathom any justifiable legal,  political, logical or humanitarian reason why he should back down from the plan. His presidency is an idea whose time has come. It is unstoppable. Ideally, Odinga is not power-hungry and his swearing in is aimed at pushing for electoral reforms. 
 As a country, we cannot vaunt about democracy when only a few individuals with resources manipulate the will of millions. NASA countless times agitated for dialogue but the ruling party was adamant they would only agree to a round-table after the October 26 election. It is only logical that Odinga be sworn in so that the discourse on moving the country forward be between equals.

Kenyans react after NASA postpones Raila swearing-in

 Raila Odinga will be sworn in as the People’s President and it would be fallacious for anyone to downplay what that means. One only has to read the political atmosphere to comprehend that millions are yearning for Odinga’s presidency. Half of the country is euphoric and eager at the prospect of having the leader they voted for. 
 Let Odinga set a precedent that if a person wins and the victory is snatched, then no one will sit pretty. Besides, its mockery for Jubilee to dangle a few Cabinet slots to NASA in bid to end stalemate. That purveys how they’ve totally missed the point.
