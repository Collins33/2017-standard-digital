A court has ordered a recount of votes in 53 polling stations in Nyatike Constituency following a petition challenging election of area MP Tom Odege.
 Justice Joseph Karanja made the ruling after lawyers from both sides agreed to narrow the prayers to recount of votes.

 Fredrick Odiso's prayers included nullification of Odege's victory and scrutiny of election materials in the election following claims of rigging.
 After consultations, Odiso's lawyer Steve Biko, Fredrick Orego, for the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and Okong'o Kennedy for Odege, agreed to concentrate on recount of votes.

 "We have all agreed that the case be narrowed down to fresh counting of votes in some polling stations," said Biko.
 Okong'o argued that the recount in the cited polling stations would make the hearing move quickly. 
 Some of the polling stations where votes will be counted afresh are Thim Lich, Wang'e Long'o, Wang'e Long'o, Aonge Dhiang', God Bim and Got Kachola.
 "The recount will address the queries Mr Odiso raised in his petition," said Biko.
 He added: "If irregularities were committed by the electoral commission during the election, it will be known during the recount of votes in the disputed polling stations." 
 Justice Karanja consented to the agreement between the lawyers. He said a report of the recount would inform the direction the case would take.
