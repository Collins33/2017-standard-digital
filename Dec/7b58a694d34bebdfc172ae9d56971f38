 The CS had just arrived for the Maragoli Festival which is held annually, to join other leaders among them NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi and Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary General Francis Atwoli.
 Wamalwa was frisked to his vehicle when the crowd turned chaotic calling him a traitor. Efforts by COTU Secretary General Francis Atwoli, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi to calm down the crowd were futile as they began stoning his car.
