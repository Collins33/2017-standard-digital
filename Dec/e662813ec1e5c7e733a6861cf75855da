Zanzibar’s Heroes stand between Kenya’s Harambee Stars and the Confederation of East and Central Africa Football Association (Cecafa) trophy at the Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos County, today. It has not been a good year for the national team but with them playing in the final, there is high hope that they will lift the Cecafa trophy just as they did in 2013 when the tournament was also held in Nairobi.
 The team is yet to lose a match and concede a goal since the tournament started, and the way they have played thus far reflects coach Paul Put’s tactical know-how. While local football fans now have high expectations from what they have seen so far, we should also learn to manage the hopes considering that coach Put has had little time to work with the team.

 Even though we have made it to today’s final, the route here has not been easy, with the team having not played well at times. That is why as fans, we need to fully get behind them today.
 We urge the players to give their best and not succumb to pressure from demanding fans. The players should know they are playing for a set of Kenyan fans who have for the most part known only pain and disappointment whenever Harambee Stars are playing.

 It is now time to redeem the country’s footballing image by winning the Cecafa trophy, but even if the result were to be different, the display of sportsmanship should be one of a team worthy of winners.
 The entire country is behind you, Harambee Stars, so go for it... Go for the stars!
