The Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup got off to a good start in Kakamega and Machakos, with the national football team Harambee Stars beating Rwanda 2-0. It was a moment to savour, seeing thousands of Kenyans, irrespective of their political, cultural, and religious persuasions, turn up to watch Harambee Stars play at the refurbished Bukhungu Stadium. This is the way to go and fans should turn up in large numbers to support our team.
 Unbelievable as it may seem, it was the first time Harambee Stars was playing at the facility in the country's 54-year history. With the usual venues - Moi International Sports Centre at Kasarani and Nyayo National Stadium-Â  shut down for renovation, Kakamega, Machakos, and Kisumu got the opportunity to host the regional tournament. The benefit of hosting such events is that they boost local businesses such as hotels because of the visitors.

 It also affords hosting counties a chance to upgrade their sports and communication infrastructure. And yesterday, the spotlight was on Kakamega County, which has spent Sh400 million to renovate Bukhungu Stadium.
 Yet for all the braggadocio and glitter from outside, questions must be asked whether the construction of such facilities meets minimum technical standards. For when the heavens suddenly opened up during yesterday's inaugural match, there was pandemonium as fans easily breached security features in search of shelter.

 While the pitch appeared to drain well from the downpour, VIPs had to be evacuated as they soaked in the rain. Is it any wonder then that CAF stripped Kenya of the right to host the Africa Nations Championship if the Kakamega County flagship stadium raises more questions than answers?
