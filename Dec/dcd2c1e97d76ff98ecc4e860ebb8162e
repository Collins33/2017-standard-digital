 Hit vehicle
 The riders torched the bus that belongs to Otange Bus Service after one of their colleagues died in an accident.
 The bus driver had parked the vehicle near a petrol station to enable a passenger alight but the motorcyclist, identified as Felix Omondi, 26,  hit it from behind, prompting a group of riders to set the bus ablaze.
 Omondi died on Monday at Homa Bay county referral hospital, where he was being treated.
 Awuor argued that the riders were wrong to burn the bus.
 “It was the rider who hit the parked vehicle. The riders should not have burned the vehicle. It was their colleague who failed to control his motorbike,” said Awuor.

 He said Otange Bus Services had operated in the area for the past 15 years and had enhanced business activities.
 Business activities
 “People who had boarded the bus are area residents and the bus has greatly contributed to economic growth in Homa Bay. This is wrong,” said Awuor.
