NAIROBI, KENYA; Family Bank has laid off 150 employees putting the figure of total bankers sent home this year to 2083.
 The institution said the decision was prompted by need to align its business to the current operating environment. This is mainly due to the depressed economic performance in the first full year under the interest rate cap regime.
