In keeping with tradition, most Kenyans travelled upcountry to be with family members during the December festive period. It is a time that family members bond and make merry, often with reckless abandon.
 The month took off on a sad note after accidents claimed more than 140 lives in the first three weeks of the month, raising a public outcry and compelling the Government to erect bumps on the notorious stretch of road between Salgaa and Sachangwan.

 It is sad to note, however, that some public service vehicle drivers have very little regard for human life.
 Most drivers, in the rush to make as many trips as possible, thereby increasing their profit margin by charging more than double the fare, could be observed weaving in and out of the long line of vehicles dangerously, overtaking on the left road shoulder where they shouldnâ€™t be driving and driving at high speed over the rumble strips recently erected.

 These reckless drivers, always in a rush that could turn fatal at any moment, account for the human error factor in road accidents.
 This dangerous attitude demands that law enforcers act with more strictness and remain alert to not only arrest errant drivers, but see to it that severe punishment is meted as a deterrent.
 Many drivers routinely ignore traffic rules because they know Sh100 can buy them passage past any road block or highway patrols by the traffic police and NTSA officials.
 Dangerous driving must be made an expensive undertaking.
