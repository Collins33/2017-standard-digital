  Doctors at Thika Level Five Hospital have successfully removed 13 of 14 needles that were lodged in the buttocks of a 10-month-old baby.
 The surgery has, however, left doctors at the hospital baffled and trying to figure out how the 14 sewing needles ended up lodged inside the toddler’s body.
 According to the baby’s mother, Jacinta Ndunge, she on November 12 took baby Jane Wairimu to hospital after noticing she was unwell.
 Ms Ndunge told The Standard when she arrived at the hospital, doctors said the child had to be admitted for screening.

 While changing her daughter’s diapers, something sharp pricked her fingers, arousing curiosity.
 Parents puzzled
 “I wondered what it was and called the nurse. After a brief incision, a sewing needle popped out, to our shock,” she said.
 The mother of four, who lives in Kiganjo Estate in Thika, said after the discovery of the needle, doctors recommended an X-ray.

 However, Kiambu County acting Health Chief Officer Andrew Toro said the baby was fine and stable.
 “The remaining one, which is lodged in her flesh but at a deeper level, cannot kill the child. The child shall stay at the hospital as doctors decide what to do next,” said Dr Toro.
