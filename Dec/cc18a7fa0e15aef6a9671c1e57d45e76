A candidate in the 2017 Kenya Certificate and Secondary Education (KCSE), has committed suicide by jumping into a well after her parents allegedly quarreled her for poor performance.
 Carren Ouma sat for the examinations at Moi Nyabohanse High school in Kuria Sub County and got a C- (minus) and could not take criticism from her parents who sources say, expected better results.

 She was among the 61,040 KCSE candidates who got C- grades even as education stakeholders raise questions over the mass failures in the examinations.
 Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangâ€™i said there was a notable improvement in the 2017 KCSE results as compared to 2016 ones where 141 candidates scored grade A.
 However, results indicate several candidates will be locked out of university and other tertiary institutions.
