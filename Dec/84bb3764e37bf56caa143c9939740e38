 However, the herders had already moved the animals to areas where the raiders could not get them.
 Realising their mission had failed, the attackers descended on shops in the township and looted them, carrying away food.
 Mr Fredrick Kanyaru, a resident, said they were living in great fear since the bandits could still be spotted in the area.
 "We had to flee our homes leaving our crops in the farms," said Mr Kanyaru.
