A three-year-old girl and her six-month-old brother died in Kithiru, Tigania West, after a fire gutted their house on Saturday night.
 The children's mother was said to have gone to fetch water 200 metres away when the house caught fire.

 Sunday, Kenya Red Cross Society personnel led by Gitonga Mugambi visited the home to give the children's mother food and household items.
 “She is traumatised. She left the children in the house as she went to fetch water but on her way back she found locals trying to put out the fire,” said Mr Mugambi.

 The woman said she did not know the cause of the fire as she had not lit any lamp or fire.
 Mugambi and the Red Cross team gave her blankets, food, and other items as the remains of the children were taken to a mortuary in Isiolo.
 Elsewhere, the body of a 23-year-old man who drowned in Ura River in Nyambene was retrieved by Kenya Red Cross divers in Kiambu Sunday morning.
 The man drowned in the raging river after heavy rains.
