 Inside sources confided that Jubilee had settled on former MPs Mpuru Aburi, Simon Mbugua, and Mohammed Nooru and Florence Jematiah and Irene Masit, while NASA has former MPs Oburu Odinga and Fatuma Ali, Kennedy Musyoka, and Norman Magaya.
 “I am still on a vote hunt. I have campaigned among the legislators and continue to do so until the last vote is cast. The response is positive and quite encouraging,” affirmed Mr Mbugua.

 He added: ” I have reached out to Jubilee, NASA, and independent MPs."
 Similarly, former Wajir County MP Fatuma Ali stepped up her campaigns.
 She said: “I have been assured of the vote and I relate well with both sides of the political divide.”
