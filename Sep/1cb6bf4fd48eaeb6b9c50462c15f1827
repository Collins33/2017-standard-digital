President Uhuru Kenyatta has said NASA leaders and their supporters are free to hold peaceful demonstrations against the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), but warned that any violence or destruction of property would be met with the full force of the law.
 “People are free to demonstrate but they must ensure that they do not destroy other people’s property. Mama mboga’s vegetables will not be destroyed. Businesses will not be attacked. Let them not think that they will break into other people’s shops and interfere with the daily routine of other Kenyans,” President Uhuru said.
