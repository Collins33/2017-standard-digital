The Opposition has vowed to peacefully march to the electoral agency's offices on Tuesday to force its top officials to resign for allegedly bungling the August vote.
 The National Super Alliance (NASA) has also accused the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) of failing to adequately address the concerns it had raised as 'irreducible minimum', protesting that the commission was proceeding with business as usual without any accountability.

 NASA has also declined to attend a consultative meeting with the commission scheduled for tomorrow, accusing the poll agency of unilaterally making decisions.
 "We will not participate in an election presided over by tainted officials. There must be some accountability on the mess that occurred," said NASA co-principal Moses Wetang'ula.

 He added that NASA's resolve to stage a peaceful protest stems from what he termed as the impunity of the commission's secretary, Ezra Chiloba, and 10 other officials they have demanded must vacate office.
 "We wrote a letter to IEBC setting our irreducible minimum. But from what we have seen, IEBC is acting and responding to us without tangible action for acts of omission or commission," said Wetang'ula.
 He went on: “We have received a letter from the chairman of the IEBC as a follow-up to a technical meeting between NASA, Jubilee, and IEBC in which the IEBC has communicated its unilateral decisions on all the critical aspects of the election, thus making any further engagement superfluous.” 
 The Senate minority leader warned those who want to take advantage of the situation that the police will deal with them.
 On Monday, the NASA chief executive officer, Norman Magaya, wrote to Nairobi Police County Commandant Japheth Koome seeking necessary security for the demonstrators.
 “We kindly request you to organise the necessary security arrangements to ensure the safety of all leaders and the citizens who will participate in the demonstrations,” read Magaya’s letter.

 But IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati, in a letter to NASA, pleaded with the alliance not to hold the demonstrations until the planned Wednesday meeting takes place, where they will engage on various issues with other stakeholders.
 Flanked by NASA affiliate leaders, the Bungoma Senator noted that Chebukati’s lette avoids entirely the issue of accountability for the illegalities and irregularities that precipitated the invalidation of the August 8 election, adding that this is despite the fact that several of its senior officers are now formally under investigation.
 The Opposition leaders maintained that the fresh election must conform with the Constitution and the law, as ordered by the Supreme Court.
