 Judge Omondi directed the legal teams to file the applications before September 29 and responses by October 2.
 “The court will also issue directions on pretrial on October 5 and on the same day have instructions on the applications.”
 In the first petition, two voters are seeking the nullification of Governor Ongwae on ground that he tampered with the election process, used county funds in the campaign. Judge Omondi directed that the negotiations be concluded within seven days until October 5.
