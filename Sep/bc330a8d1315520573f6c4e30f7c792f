Family business-focused lender M Oriental Bank has revealed that it has stopped doing business with debt-ridden retailer Nakumatt. Responding to a story carried by The Standard last month in which the retailer&rsquo;s debt position was reported to have jumped from Sh18 billion to about Sh30 billion, M Oriental Bank said it no longer had exposure in Nakumatt. According to the bank&rsquo;s chief executive officer, Rakesh Kashyap, the Sh150 million loan that the bank had advanced to the retailer in August 2012 was fully paid back in February 2013. &ldquo;As of now, we do not have any exposure in Nakumatt. We do not have any business with them. Going by our size, we are very cautious not to take such a big hit,&rdquo; said Mr Kashyap. A loan statement for Nakumatt seen by The Standard indicates that the retailer cleared the loan on February 5, 2013.
