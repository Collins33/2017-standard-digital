 The Bill is aimed at amending the Urban Areas and Cities Act, 2011 to cater for the classification of urban centres in a more realistic manner. In the current law, only Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu are classified as cities. “Under the Bill, there would be five cities, 64 municipalities, 66 townships and 80 market centres,” a statement from State House reads.
