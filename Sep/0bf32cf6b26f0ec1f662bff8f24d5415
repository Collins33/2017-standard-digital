 A petition filed by the duo in the Supreme Court annulled the August 8 presidential election. Since then, President Uhuru has had unkind words for the court calling some of its judges “wakora” (crooks) and promising to cut the court to size.
 His party, Jubilee, is sponsoring amendments on electoral law to water down the powers of the court.

 NASA, on the other hand, insists there will be no re-run of the presidential election unless some IEBC officials are removed from office.
 While confirming the withdrawal, Raila spokesman Dennis Onyango said the bodyguards were last night asked to report to GSU headquarters in Nairobi for further instructions.
 The withdrawal of the security detail comes on the day the two leaders are expected to lead their supporters in a  demonstration to push for the removal of Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) officials whom they accuse of bungling the presidential poll in favour the Jubilee candidate President Uhuru Kenyatta.
 "The withdrawal of my security and that of Raila is illegal. The law requires presidential candidates to have an all round security protection," said  Kalonzo Musyoka Tuesday.
