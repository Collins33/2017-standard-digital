The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has gazetted Kitutu Chache South parliamentary by-election for November 7. IEBC had in July announced that the poll would not be held on August 8 during the General Election and that a later date (November 7) would be issued. This was after Jubilee candidate Leonard Gwaro Mwamba&nbsp;died in a road accident in July 2017.

The late Mwamba perished on July 14 when a car he was traveling in was involved in a fatal accident along the Kisii-Kisumu road. On August 8, voters in Kitutu Chache South Constituency, Kisii County cast votes for only five elective seats. Incumbent Richard Onyonka of Ford Kenya is facing ODM&#39;s Samuel Omwando among other candidates for the parliamentary seat. The Supreme Court Friday nullified President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election in August 8 polls upholding NASA leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s petition. The Court ordered fresh presidential elections to be supervised by IEBC within 60 days. The new election date is yet to be announced.&nbsp;
