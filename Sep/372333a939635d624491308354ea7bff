 He appealed to residents of Busia to support his re-election bid.
 The President said he was sure that support from Dr Otuoma and former Budalang’i MP Ababu Namwamba would translate into a large number of votes from the region.
 “I have no doubt in my mind that you people of Busia will vote for us so that we can continue with the work we started of improving infrastructure and reviving factories to create jobs for our people,” he said.
 The President maintained that he won the last August 8 presidential election and would emerge victorious in the repeat exercise.
 “We won the elections but the Supreme Court nullified our victory. But for the sake of peace and stability in the country we accepted to go back to the ballot so that citizens can decide who they want to be their president,” he said.
 He criticised the Opposition for giving pre-conditions before they can participate in the elections.
