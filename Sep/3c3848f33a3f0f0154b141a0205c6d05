A former ODM politician has claimed that the Opposition leader, Raila Odinga, has no track record in Western Kenya and the country at large.
 Speaking in Busia town on Friday, former Funyula Member of Parliament (MP) Paul Otuoma stated that he has supported Raila since 1992 and the former Prime Minister has no development agenda for Kenyans.

 He took a swipe at Raila saying that William Ruto dumped the Opposition years back and is now the Deputy President.
 “My brother William Ruto left us in ODM still singing about baba and now he is the Deputy President. We have said enough is enough and this is why we want to support Jubilee, the winning team,” said Dr Otuoma.

 He assured President Uhuru Kenyatta that the people of Busia will spearhead his re-election during the repeat presidential election slated for October 26.
 “We want to form the next Government with the people of Busia being part of President Kenyatta’s transformative agenda,” stated Otuoma.
 The vote hunting mission in Busia County was also graced by President Uhuru, DP Ruto, Chris Okemo, Fred Gumo and Cabinet Secretary for Water and Irrigation, Eugene Wamalwa.
 Otuoma officially announced last week that he would support Uhuru’s re-election bid in the repeat poll.
 “Nasa did not want me. Raila will realise that he made a mistake by deciding to take sides in the Busia governorship contest.
 “You cannot call yourself a national leader and behind closed doors you are dividing the same people supporting you,” said Otuoma who lost to Governor Sospeter Ojaamong in the August 8 General Election.
