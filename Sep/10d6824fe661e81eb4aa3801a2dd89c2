ISIOLO, KENYA: A pharmacist died in&nbsp;Isiolo County after a&nbsp;grenade, innocently given to him by a curious herdsman, went off as he held it in his hands. The herder, identified as Sare Deko, had taken the&nbsp;grenade&nbsp;to&nbsp;Mahat Abdi Daware, the pharmacist, at Skot market to see if he could identify the strange object he said he had taken from some children, according to the Isiolo Administration Police commander.
