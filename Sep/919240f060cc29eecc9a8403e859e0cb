  The body of a man was found dangling from the roof of his house as that of his wife lay in a pool of blood in Tayari village on the outskirts of Molo town.
 Grief engulfed the village as neighbours reported that the two, Jacinta Nyambura and Daniel Mwangi, were involved in a domestic quarrel at around 7pm before the woman was heard screaming for help.

 "We responded immediately the woman screamed but could not get into the house as it had a very strong door locked from inside. The man realised the mess he had got into and committed suicide," said Mr Itume.
 Residents brought down part of the wall and the door to get into the house and found the man hanging from the roof with a rope around the neck.
 The woman had been stabbed in the neck, chest, and stomach several times. A sachet was found on the floor, suggesting that the man might have taken poison.
 Shocked residents said the couple, in their early 20s, lived in peace and had never engaged in a fight.
 "We had no reason to suspect the two would get to the extent of a brutal murder and suicide.
 "I had never heard them arguing before and they appeared to be happy with each other since they moved in together," said Silas Owiti, a neighbour.

 “We were able to identify the deceased and took their bodies to the Molo sub-county mortuary pending investigations,” said area chief Hassan Waweru.
 In a note found in the house, Mwangi accused his wife of having an affair with another man, saying he could no longer live with it.
  Suicide and murder
 The chief urged residents, especially young couples, to seek counselling and expressed concern at the increasing cases of suicide and murder involving domestic disputes.

 "We are living at the mercy of these youths who seem to enjoy some form of protection from political leaders.
 Bailed out
 "They are always bailed out by these leaders whenever police arrest them," said Sam Ochieno, a resident.
 On Monday evening, the youths are reported to have gone on a revenge mission after attending the burial of one of their colleagues at a local Muslim cemetery.
 "We heard rumours of an impending revenge attack. Information was passed to the relevant authorities but they failed us when they did not act on available intelligence," said Ochieno.
 Eyewitnesses said the youths were avenging the deaths of two of their colleagues who were lynched by a mob after being implicated in a robbery.
 Left for dead
 Mr Simion Mwaweje, a 30-year-old carpenter, was cut on the head, right arm, and shoulder and left for dead on Monday evening.
 "I had just left my workshop and was headed home when I was waylaid by the gang," said Mwawaje.
