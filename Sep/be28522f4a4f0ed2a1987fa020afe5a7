 The new lawmaker, however, denied the making any abusive statement in reference to President Kenyatta.
 “I will not apologise to anyone because I called nobody’s name during my yesterday’s address.”
 Protests
 “We have so many presidents in Kenya, from the president of Sonu to all presidents of students union in Kenya, president of the Supreme Court, president of youth senate and many more. However I will stick to objective politics and will never abuse anybody,” he said in a Facebook post.
 Later in the day, groups believed to be supporters of President Kenyatta staged protests along Thika Road at Githurai, Juja Town, Thika Town, Githunguri, Limuru, Ruiru and Gatundu and Kiambu town calling for the arrest of Owino. The groups blocked the roads for hours as police watched from a distance inconveniencing many motorists and pedestrians. They used twigs and stones to block the roads while some of the protesters lit bonfires. Police later dispersed them.
 Nairobi County Woman Representative Esther Passaris condemned the utterances.

 Passaris said despite their political differences with the Jubilee Party members, some standards had to be maintained.
 “I would like to condemn in the strongest terms possible utterances made by my fellow MP Babu Owino during our campaign rally the other day. No matter how big our differences or how low we think of each other, there is a line that should not be crossed,” she said.
 Apologies
 The woman representative apologised to Uhuru’s family for what she termed as disrespect meted on them.
 “As a mother, I sincerely apologise to the former first lady, Mama Ngina Kenyatta and her family over the insult and disrespect meted on her,” she added.
