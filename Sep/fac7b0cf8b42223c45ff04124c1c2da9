He made reference to the election of a member of the county assembly (MCA) in Kajiado who has a disability. The President also saluted the large number of young people who were elected. &quot;Today I am a proud Kenyan for the gains we have made in promoting inclusion of women into elected office. I am proud because I have great confidence in Kenya&#39;s women and deep faith in their capacities.&quot; He said the young men and women elected have a special responsibility to represent the aspirations of the youth in employment opportunities and better service delivery. There are five senators, 23 MPs, and three woman representatives who fall under the category of youth. &quot;Nevertheless, as important as these gains are, we recognise we still have much more work to do to increase their participation in national leadership,&quot; he said in reference to the two-thirds gender rule that has yet to be implemented. President Kenyatta also lauded the performance of the last Parliament, which he said had made its mark on the country&#39;s history to entrench devolution.
