 Mr Chepchieng' said the suspects were helping police to unmask other members of the gang, adding they would be arraigned in court once the probe was complete.
 "We moved swiftly and the information we received gave us four suspects.
 "We are happy to report the four have been arrested and are currently helping police with investigations,” he said.
 Chepchieng’ said it was not a politically motivated attack as the gang was specifically after items that included a bicycle and mobile phones.
 The county commissioner said  the gang searched for valuables in another homestead and on finding none, decided to slaughter a chicken and cook it alongside 32 eggs.
 He pointed out that political attacks usually follow a particular pattern, where victims are asked specific questions and goons wear party logos.
