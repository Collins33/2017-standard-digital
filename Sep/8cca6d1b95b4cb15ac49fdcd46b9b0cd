Immediate former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga is challenging Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti&#39;s re-election. Magwanga who became second after Awiti in the August General 8 election filed the petition with booklets of more than 15 pages at Homa Bay High Court on Wednesday evening. In the petition, Magwanga has sued The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), Homa Bay County Returning Officer Michael Kosgei, Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti and his Deputy Hamilton Orata. Speaking after filing the petition, Magwanga expressed concern that the IEBC officials who manned the General election deprived him of victory which he deserved. &quot;I have come here to seek justice as a law abiding citizen. I have perused all documents which have convinced me that I won the election with a very big margin,&quot; said Magwanga. He said the recent ruling on the presidential election results set a precedence that should be used by all courts to provide Kenyans who file election petitions with justice. &quot;I have faith in the court following how the Chief Justice ruled the presidential election petition. I have gathered enough evidence hence it is my belief that the people of Homa Bay will be accorded justice in this matter. His Deputy Joshua Orero called on the area residents be calm give and give the court an opportunity to end what he termed as impunity. &quot;Time for impunity must come to an end. We are in hands of the right people,&quot; said Orero. Magwanga&#39;s case will be handled by Muma and Kanjama law firm. In the petition, Magwanga prays that he be declared the winner if votes are counted to reveal that he actually won the election. Mention of the case is set to be made on a later date.
