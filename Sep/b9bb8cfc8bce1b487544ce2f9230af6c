A section of Kenyans have been angered by Mombasa Governor Joho’s arrest and detention on Monday morning.
 The governor was arrested when he stormed the Nyali Police Station and demanded the release of seven County Inspectorate officers who were apprehended while demolishing walls on what the governor described as grabbed public land.

 "I have established that the Police Commander here and his officers here are simply trying to aid someone to grab public land,” said Joho.
