 She pointed out that the remarks made by the MP do not reflect the character of the National Super Alliance leader (NASA), Raila Odinga, or the coalition principals.
 “As a mother, I sincerely apologize to the former First Lady, Her Excellency Mama Ngina Kenyatta, and her family over the insult and disrespect meted on her, which neither depicts nor reflects the character or direction envisaged by our Party leader The Rt Hon.

 Passaris’s statement:
 I would like to condemn in the strongest terms possible the utterances made by my fellow MP Babu Owino during our campaign rally in Westlands and Dagoretti North yesterday. No matter how big our differences or how low we think of each other, there is a line that should not be crossed.
