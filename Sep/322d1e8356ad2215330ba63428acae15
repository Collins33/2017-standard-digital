Ukambani leaders clashed at State House on Monday over who should lead the Jubilee Party campaign in the region. A rift emerged after prominent businessman Peter Muthoka was last weekend picked to spearhead President Uhuru&#39;s re-election bid.

But yesterday, leaders turned against one another before President Uhuru and his deputy, William Ruto, with some leaders calling their colleagues &#39;political brokers&#39;. It started with former Mwingi Central MP Joe Mutambo asking the President to give him audience over a matter he wanted addressed in private. But Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko took to the podium to tell him off, asking Uhuru to stop engaging in boardroom meetings with some leaders. Hotel meetings Mr Sonko told Mr Mutambo that he should be on the ground campaigning instead of engaging in hotel meetings that will not help Uhuru&#39;s bid. &quot;I want to say here that there should be no meeting to bring people together over issues we can resolve as Kamba leaders. We either unite to deliver the votes or fail in our plans,&quot; said Sonko. Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua asked Uhuru to stop engaging brokers but deal with the people through their elected leaders.

The leaders, however, resolved to ensure that Uhuru gets more support in a region perceived to be in the National Super Alliance (NASA) co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka&#39;s political grip. They accused Kalonzo of misleading the region.
