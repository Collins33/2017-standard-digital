 The vocal governor stormed the station demanding release of seven County Inspectorate officers who were apprehended while carrying out demolitions, leading to his arrest.
 According to Joho, the police boss was working with other police officers to grab public land.
 He, however, noted that police were working on orders from above.
 "I have established that the Police Commander here and his officers here are simply trying to aid someone to grab public land,” said Joho.
 The ODM Vice Chairman and National Super Alliance leader (NASA) has later been released after the incident.
