 President Uhuru indicated on Friday that the Opposition leader cannot continue holding Kenya hostage with unending conditions over how the repeat election should be carried out.
 Speaking in Kiambu County, the Head of State said that Raila does not want to go to the poll because he knows he will lose.
 “Mungu ni yule yule na waKenya ni wale wale” (God is still the same and Kenyans are still the same). That is why he does not want an election,” Uhuru pointed out.
 The President also called on Kenyans to embrace peace before, during and after the fresh election.
