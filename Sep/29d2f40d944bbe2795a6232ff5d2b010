In 2008, Tsvangirai beat Mugabe in the first round of voting but failed to secure an outright majority, leading to a run-off. He later pulled out of the second round, due violence against his supporters. The MDC is now part of an opposition alliance formed ahead of the 2018 vote, in a bid to unseat the 93-year-old Mugabe. The Saturday rally in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe&#39;s second city, was the first gathering of the alliance since its formation last month. Tsvangirai told supporters that there should be &quot;clear reforms&quot; in place ahead of the next election to avoid disputes. Past elections in Zimbabwe have been marred by violence, intimidation and charges of electoral fraud.
