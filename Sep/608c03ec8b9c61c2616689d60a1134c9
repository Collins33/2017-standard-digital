Raila Odinga&#39;s private secretary was on Wednesday violently ejected from a NASA Parliamentary Group (PG) meeting over claims that he was spying for Jubilee Party. Rowdy youths kicked out Dr Noah Akala from the Okoa Kenya secretariat, where Raila and other NASA co-principals were chairing the meeting. ALSO READ: Whatever happens, life must go on, says Raila &quot;You are a Jubilee mole... Get out and go to your masters,&quot; a leader of the rowdy youth was heard shouting at him as they dragged him out of the gate. Attempts by the bodyguards of Raila and other MPs attending the PG to rescue Akala from the mob that was baying for his blood failed as the more than 20 youths overpowered them as they shoved and manhandled the aide. Men in Black Journalists who attempted to take photographs were warned as the &#39;Men in Black&#39; roughed up Akala in a manner reminiscent of the way former ODM Executive Director Magerer Langat was bundled out of Orange House. In 2013, the &#39;Men in Black&#39; disrupted an ODM delegates conference that was being held in the Kasarani gymnasium as they overturned tables, kicked ballot boxes, and bungled the elections of the Orange party.&nbsp;
