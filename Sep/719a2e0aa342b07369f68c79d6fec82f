Uhuru knows very well that he is a one-term president. I will not contest, I&#39;ll support Raila Odinga, he means well for this great nation,&quot; stressed Dida. Uhuru hit out at the Supreme Court on Saturday questioning the grounds on which his nullification was determined. Accompanied by his deputy, William Ruto, he threatened to &lsquo;deal with&rsquo; the Judiciary should he be re-elected. &ldquo;Even if you are so stupid, ask yourself something: The people elected an MCA, results were transmitted, and no one asked questions. Those of MPs and senators were transmitted, and no one asked questions and they have been sworn in. &ldquo;Those of governors were transmitted, no one asked questions. Now how do four people and wake up and say there was a technicality in the transmission of the results of the President only? How?&rdquo; asked Uhuru. The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) led by its President, Isaac Okero, censured the Head of State and other leaders against such attacks on the Court. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Will Raila Odinga win last battle?
