A gang staged a daring raid at Mwiria coffee factory in Embu North sub-county and stole coffee worth Sh1.5 million on Thursday night.
  A committee member, John Rutere, said agro-chemicals worth Sh300, 000 that was to be distributed to farmers, a generator and power saw were also stolen.

 The robbers took two computers and record books that contained crucial information relating to an ongoing inquiry into loss of money in the parent Central Ngandori Cooperative Society.
 "We suspect the theft is meant to derail the ongoing inquiry into the malpractices that happened in the society leading to loss of money from sale of coffee and failure to pay farmers their dues.

 However, the stolen documents will not affect the inquiry," said Rutere. The assailants broke into the factory at around midnight and tied up two guards before loading the 2,480 kilos of coffee beans in the stores, drying tables and packed them into a vehicle and fled.
 Mr Rutere said the guards raised the alarm at around 2pm after the thugs had left. The theft was reported at Manyatta Police Station. Area OCPD Mark Wanjala visited the factory as part of their investigations.
