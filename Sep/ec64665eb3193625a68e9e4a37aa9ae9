Data from the Central Bank of Kenya&rsquo;s Credit Survey released yesterday showed the local banking sector&rsquo;s loan book growth had shrunk by 0.84 per cent from March when it grew by two per cent. Wait-and-see approach This was despite demand for credit in trade and household sectors increasing as Kenyans took advantage of reduced cost of borrowing. According to CBK, the decrease in gross loans was mainly attributed to a reduction in loans granted to support the transport and communication, trade, agricultural, real estate and the mining and quarrying sectors. Forty-five per cent of the banks surveyed held the view that the actual credit granted had decreased after the cap on interest rates as lenders adopted a wait-and-see approach to gauge how the market would react to the rate cap. The ratio of gross non-performing loans to gross loans at the same time increased from 9.5 per cent in March to 9.91 per cent in June.&nbsp; ALSO READ: 12 lenders ignore Central Bank of Kenya regulations
