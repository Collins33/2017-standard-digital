Former Bomet governor Isaac Ruto has indicated that he has not defected to the Jubilee Party, reiterating that he is still the party leader of Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM).
 Speaking to the Nairobian, Ruto pointed out that he decided to support President Uhuru Kenyatta because majority of people who voted for him (Ruto), also chose Uhuru as their leader in the August 8 General Election.

 "I was persuaded by the need to keep the community together and the fact that 60% of the people who voted for me still voted for Uhuru Kenyatta. Only 35% agreed with me and voted NASA. I have not defected. I am still the party leader of Chama Cha Mashinani,” Ruto stressed.
 Ruto ditched NASA for the Jubilee Party weeks ago, a move that was met by strong criticism from Raila Odinga supporters, with most arguing that he never gave any substantial votes to help NASA in Bomet County.

 Speaking during a rally at Kapkatet after receiving President Uhuru and his deputy William Ruto, the former NASA co-principal said that he realised he did not have followers and that is why he returned to support Uhuru’s re-election bid.
 “I have come back to support President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto. I realised I had few followers. I have come back to join you,” stated Ruto.
 Ruto, who was defeated by Bomet Governor Joyce Laboso in the August polls, had vowed that he would not abandon NASA for Jubilee.
