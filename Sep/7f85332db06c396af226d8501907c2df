NAIROBI, KENYA: The empty streets and closed shops that characterised the aftermath of the&nbsp;August&nbsp;8 General Election saw that&nbsp;month&nbsp;rated&nbsp;as the&nbsp;worst&nbsp;for&nbsp;businesses&nbsp;in four&nbsp;years. Stanbic Bank&rsquo;s Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) survey done on procurement officers in the private sector released yesterday dropped to the lowest point last&nbsp;month&nbsp;in its first review of an election&nbsp;year.

Notably, the anxiety around a tense General Election in&nbsp;August&nbsp;was one of the major factors that weighed down the private sector,&rdquo; said Regional Economist for East Africa at Stanbic Bank Jibran Qureishi. Output fell while there was also less money in circulation as well as weak demand as new orders fell for the first time in the survey&rsquo;s history. Private sector Employment in the private sector also fell in&nbsp;August&nbsp;- the first decline in the survey&rsquo;s history - even though the&nbsp;rate&nbsp;of job shedding was marginal. Mr Qureishi said although the decision by the Supreme Court to annul the outcome of the presidential vote was a reflection of Kenya&rsquo;s strengthening institutions and will certainly appease the foreign investor community,&nbsp;businesses&nbsp;will pay the price in the short-term. &ldquo;This angst is likely to extend over the coming&nbsp;months&nbsp;due to the recent decision by the Supreme Court to nullify the presidential election results,&rdquo; he said.

Diaspora remittances rose to Sh92 billion over the first six&nbsp;months&nbsp;of 2017, a four per cent increase compared to Sh88.3 billion in the first half of 2016. Remittances have over time grown to be the single largest foreign exchange earner, towering over other productive sectors such as tourism, tea, horticulture and coffee. &ldquo;A stronger euro currency will probably be quite beneficial for horticultural earnings while tourist arrivals are probably likely to increase further as political temperatures eventually cool down after the fresh presidential elections,&rdquo; said Qureishi.
