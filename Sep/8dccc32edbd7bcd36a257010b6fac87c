  “We strongly condemn this attack and are closely monitoring his condition,” the party said in a separate statement.
 "This cowardly attack on one of Tanzania's most fearless and prominent politicians raises concerns about the safety of all dissident voices in the country, at a time when space for dissent is quickly shrinking. The authorities must take steps to reassure Tanzanians and the world that his shooting was not politically motivated,” Human rights groups stated.
 President John Pombe Magufuli ordered relevant authorities to find the culprits and prosecute them.
 Magufuli, condemned the attack and also wished his fierce critic a quick recovery.
 Lissu has previously been arrested by police on several occasions and charged with incitement.
 He was apprehended in July and later released after having called Magufuli a "dictator" over alleged attacks on the opposition and the media.
