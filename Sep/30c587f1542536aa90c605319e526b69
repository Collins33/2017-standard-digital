The High Court Wednesday declined to give interim orders to former governor Peter Munya and senatorial aspirant Mugambi Imanyara in separate petitions they are pursuing over the August 8 elections. Lawyers for the two were pursuing orders to enable them to get result declaration forms from all the polling stations and to be allowed to put extra seals on the boxes holding the votes cast in the election.

Election court &quot;The view of this court is that these matters are best pursued at the election court, which we expect to be gazetted by Friday and working by next week,&quot; Justice Francis Gikonyo ruled. Mr Munya is challenging the win of Kiraitu Murungi of Jubilee Party (JP), who garnered 281,737 votes against his 232,569, while Mr Imanyara, who had 183,723 votes, is challenging Mithika Linturi (JP), who had 308,711 votes. Justice Gikonyo fixed September 28 as the mention date, but informed the two that they could still pursue their applications as soon the election court is set up. The judge also made a similar ruling and gave the same mention date in the petition filed by Buuri parliamentary aspirant Mugambi Angaine (PNU), who is petitioning the win by Mugambi Rindikiri (JP).
