Naikuni said the board aims to enhance surveillance to ensure products entering the Kenyan market are safe to use. &ldquo;The available testing laboratories do not have such capacity as the new facility has now,&rdquo; said Naikuni. The director said the laboratory, housed at the PPB headquarters in Nairobi, will be used for the chemical, biological, biochemical, physiological, and pharmaceutical evaluation of the products. Pharmaceutical products &quot;By so doing, we will be going a step further to tame fake pharmaceutical products that may harm the population,&quot; Dr Naikuni said. He added: &quot;The laboratory will test both locally manufactured and imported medicinal substances to ensure that all substances approved for the market are safe, efficacious, and of high quality.&quot; The laboratory, which becomes the fifth directorate of the board, was established upon recommendation by an inter-ministerial task force of November 2009.
