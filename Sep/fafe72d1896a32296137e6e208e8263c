All routes accessing the CBD from Thika Road, Kiambu Road and Ruiru will be at Murang&#39;a Road (Fig Tree) terminus B. All vehicles using Juja Road, Ring Road and Park Road to access CBD will park at Ngara Road Terminus. PSVs using Jogoo road and Lusaka road will park at Muthurwa Terminus whereas those from Ngong Road will park at Railway terminus. Other termini include Desai Service Road Terminus, Park Road Terminus, Hakati Terminus, Machakos terminus and the Central Bus Station. In May, the county government under former Governor Evans Kidero moved to ban all PSVs from accessing the CBD after it was accused of failing to deal with traffic congestion. The Matatu Owners Association through its Chair Simon Kimutai, however, indicated that Kidero&rsquo;s team had not involved them in drafting the regulations. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Mega city transport projects that never take off The Gazette notice: Gazette Notice NO 4479 (Photo: Courtesy) &nbsp;
