A widow stripped naked on Tuesday at the Ministry of Lands in Nakuru, claiming that officials there had refused to help her recover land allegedly taken by relatives.
 Salome Njoki, a resident of Bahati, said a quarter-acre left by her husband Julius Muchemi had been taken by her relatives.
 “My husband had bought a piece of land at Bahati but registered it under his mother’s name. All I want is the land be registered under my name because his family want to take it away from me,” said Njoki.
 She took off her clothes and climbed a guava tree before starting to scream.

 It took several women at least half an hour to persuade her to come down and put on her clothes as police kept their distance.
 She was later whisked away by the police, who promised to follow up the matter.
