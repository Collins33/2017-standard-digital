Supporters of the National Super Alliance on Tuesday staged protests to demand the exit of top officials of the electoral agency, whom they accused of bungling the August 8 polls.
 The largely peaceful demonstrations took place in Nairobi and Kisumu towns, where dozens of NASA supporters marched to the offices of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).

 In Kisumu, dozens of heavily armed police officers stood and watched in the town's sweltering heat as protesters marched through the streets.
 Kisumu is known for violent confrontations with the police during demonstrations, but things were markedly different this time round, with business people, who had shut their shops, re-opening after a few hours.
