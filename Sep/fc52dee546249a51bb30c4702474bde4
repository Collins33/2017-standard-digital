  Whenever the phrase ‘business community’ is mentioned, the image that comes to mind is that of executives in sharp suits and ties.
 So when a group that identified itself as the Gema Business Community called a press conference to warn supporters of the National Super Alliance (NASA) not to disrupt business in the central business district (CBD), this is the image that many expected.

 But as it turned out, the team looked a little different. The press conference could easily have passed for an announcement about some reggae concert that was coming to town as some of the speakers wore dreadlocks and caps.

 But it is the image of Charles Mwangi, an entrepreneur based in Kibra, that has become the face of the ‘Gema Business Community’.
 Mr Mwangi’s picture generated an online buzz after another image of a policeman who bears an uncanny resemblance to him appeared online.
 Thursday, The Standard tracked down Mr Mwangi to his shop in Kibra, where he runs a video show in the slum. He also offers video shooting and editing services.
 He cuts the image of a popular entrepreneur, given the number of interruptions he receives from greetings as we conduct the interview. His shop is called Ghetto Child Audio and Visual Studio.
  “I was born here in Kibra, I went to Lang’ata Road Primary School and I have been a resident here for a long time. I have done many businesses, including being one of the first people to start repairing computers here,” Mwangi says.
 Two plainclothes policemen walk into the shop carrying their walkie talkies, greet him by name, and continue with their patrols. He is referred to as ‘Ras’ and ‘Mwas.’

 Mwangi denied ever being a policeman or having any close relatives in the force. When we showed him the picture he laughs and asks us to look at him more closely.
  “That guy is dark and I heard after all this talk started that he is from Embu or Kirinyaga,” he said.
 Deputy Inspector General of Administration Police Samuel Arachi said the man in uniform whose picture had been widely circulated on social media is a genuine and serving officer.

 He termed as ‘falsehoods and malice’ claims that the man in dreadlocks is the one who was captured in anti-riot police gear on Tuesday.
 Arachi said his office had asked officials at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to investigate those behind the pictures circulating on social media.
