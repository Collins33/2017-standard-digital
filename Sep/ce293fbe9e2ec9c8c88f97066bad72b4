Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has promised that he will continue with his plan to reduce parking fees, but by a lower percentage - 30 per cent. He, however, did not say when the new rate would be implemented. While responding to a question raised by a resident, Sonko said he was waiting for the county assembly to resume its sitting before he tables a new Bill that would allow for the changes.

The outcome will be communicated in due course,&quot; said Sonko. In his manifesto, Sonko promised to reduce parking fees from the current Sh300 to Sh150 within the first 100 days of his tenure. However while meeting with the Matatu Owners Association, he revised the rate to 30 per cent and not the 50 per cent that was promised during his campaigns. The governor also left the time for delivering this promise open, just stating that this would be done &#39;in the next fiscal year&#39; contrary to the 100 days promised during his campaigns. &quot;My administration will reduce parking and impounding fees by 30 per cent,&quot; said Sonko.
