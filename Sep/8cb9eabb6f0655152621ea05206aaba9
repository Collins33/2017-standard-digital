Erick Oduor Olik, who guards a private residence in Race Course estate, Wareng District in Uasin Gishu, was accused of&nbsp;defiling the minor on diverse dates between December 2, 2016 and August 18, 2017 within the estate. Oduor is said to have enticed the minor with money before holding her in his house for entire the period. The minor later reported the matter at Langas Police Station with the help of the area chief. The accused person was arrested by officers from Langas Police Station where he recorded statements and was later arraigned before Principal Magistrate Harrison Barasa. The magistrate rejected Olik&#39;s pleas to be&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to settle the matter with the minor&#39;s family out of court. He told the accused&nbsp;to wait for the hearing&nbsp;to commence in order to put across his defense. The magistrate explained that the matter was a criminal offence and could not be arbitrated outside the court. &quot;This is a serious criminal offence and not a civil issue either and cannot be solved outside the confines of the court. The case must follow the laid down legal procedures and you will have time to defend yourself,&quot; Barasa directed. He further cautioned the accused to stay away from the complainant until the case was concluded, explaining that any interference will be factored in the judgement of the court.
