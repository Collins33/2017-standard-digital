I found myself alone and I have now decided to come back. Today I have returned to where I belong,&quot; Ruto stressed as he addressed an excited crowd in Kapkatet, Kericho County. &nbsp; Ruto, who was defeated by Bomet Governor Joyce Laboso in the August polls, had recently vowed that he would not ditch NASA for the Jubilee Party. &quot;I am in NASA to stay. I have decided to maintain a low profile to allow Bomet people to settle. I know the election was marred with a lot of irregularities since government machinery were used to intimidate my supporters,&quot; said Ruto. &quot;I am Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) party leader. How can I defect to another political outfit. Jubilee has not approached me but I have seen things blown out of proportion on social media,&quot; he added. He described himself as a &#39;wounded general&#39; at war, saying NASA is a coalition and that he may decide to join the Opposition campaign rallies or maintain a low profile.
