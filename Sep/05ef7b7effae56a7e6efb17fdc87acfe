Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa has called on the national government to withhold National Super Alliance (NASA) leader Raila Odinga’s passport ahead of the repeat presidential poll.
 Mr Barasa said Raila was likely to cause chaos then flee the country. He said he would sponsor a Bill in Parliament to ensure that Raila surrendered his passport before the election.

 “I will go to Parliament to ensure that Raila surrenders his passport as he will cause chaos and flee. We want him here,” said Mr Barasa.
 "The Opposition is likely to cause trouble should their demands to have the election postponed fail," he added. "The Opposition is scared and has resorted to inciting their supporters to take to the streets and cause mayhem."

 Barasa said his Bill would ensure that NASA leaders were present to witness first hand the state of the country should they call for mass action.
 The MP accused Opposition leaders of a plot to use violence to get into office.
 "They have been engaging in violence to intimidate their rivals and that should not be the case in the new dispensation," he said.
 “We should have a peaceful election. There is no need for people to cause violence in order to attain political office. This is why I want Raila's passport detained,” he said.
 He said it was wrong for the Opposition to claim it wanted reforms at the electoral commission yet they were unable to hold free and fair party nominations ahead of the August 8 General Election.
