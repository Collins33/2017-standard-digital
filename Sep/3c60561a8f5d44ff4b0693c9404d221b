 Reacting to an exclusive story carried by The Standard last week, Dr Mailu said he could not dispute the results just yet and advised the family to visit the referral hospital for tests and treatment.
 Rehema, 12, developed a swelling on the neck and had breathing complications as the lump grew bigger.

 REFERRAL HOSPITAL
 She was first taken to a Kilifi hospital, where she was told she had TB.
 "I can't speak on the results as it could be right or a misdiagnosis. However, they should come to Kenyatta, where she will be evaluated and treatment done for free," said Mailu.
 But the CS did not say what measures would be taken if the results were confirmed negative for TB. The girl's family said it had exhausted all its funds on her, only to be told by a specialists that it could be lymphoma.
 The hospital yesterday carried out a series of tests and ordered that Rehema receive blood transfusion since her conditioned had deteriorated.
