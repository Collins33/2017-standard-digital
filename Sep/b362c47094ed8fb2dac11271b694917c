Businessman Jimmy Wanjigi has accused Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet of ignoring complaints that his life is in danger.
 Mr Wanjigi, who had asked Mr Boinnet eight days ago to provide him with security at his own cost, has sought the intervention of Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Keriako Tobiko to compel an investigation into threats against his life.

 He wrote to Mr Tobiko on Wednesday, explaining that despite complaining to police earlier, no one had contacted him for further verification.
 “To date, the IG has ignored and/or failed to respond to or acknowledge our said letter, despite the urgency called for,” Wanjigi said in a letter through his lawyer Elizabeth Karoki.

 Police protection
 He wrote to the IG on September 13 to say that death threats had been directed at him, and asked for police protection.
 But instead, he said, some senior police officers had dismissed the claims, terming them false without investigating them.
 In his letter, Wanjigi took issue with Director of Criminal Investigations Ndegwa Muhoro’s remarks quoted in a local daily dismissing the threats as false.
 “We are therefore calling upon you to intervene and direct the IG to comprehensively investigate our client’s report as requested in our said letter,” he told the DPP.
 Wanjigi copied the September 20 letter to Boinnet, asking him to respond to his earlier one.

 Sources said Wanjigi had been forced to change his modus operandi over the threats he is taking seriously.
 For instance, the sources said, he has changed his residence, vehicles and the times he leaves his workplace.
