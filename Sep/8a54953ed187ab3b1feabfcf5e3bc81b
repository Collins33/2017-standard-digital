County Deputy Governor Julius Leseeto praised the volunteer nurses for working round the clock and with commitment to care for the patients. Mr Leseeto promised that the team would be permanently employed soon to address shortage of nurses in the county&rsquo;s health facilities. He said the county government had been paying the voluntary nurses upkeep allowance to motivate them. &quot;They have been receiving some little allowances but the county government will employ them soon,&quot; said Leseeto. He urged the county public service board to move with speed to recruit the whole team so that they can support service delivery at the county&rsquo;s health facilities. The county chief officer in charge of health, Lydia Letinina, said the team&#39;s passion and commitment to serve patients has been of great encouragement. &quot;Their services have greatly alleviated the pain and agony that patients would have gone through during the nurses&#39; strike,&quot; said Ms Letinina.
