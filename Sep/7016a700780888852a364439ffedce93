  Opposition leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka have protested against the scaling down of the number of security officers assigned to them.
 Odinga said nobody has explained to him why his security has been withdrawn.

 “I woke up to find my security and that of Kalonzo withdrawn. I'm entitled to security and I will enjoy it, not at the behest or sympathy of (President) Uhuru Kenyatta,” said Odinga.
 Kalonzo termed the withdrawal illegal.

 But police spokesman George Kinoti said the number of officers assigned the two leaders had only been scaled down.
 “Go to their homes and see if there are no officers manning there. It is just scaling down on the number,” said Kinoti.
 He said the exercise was being done on all VIPs and not just NASA leaders.
 Another senior police officer said the withdrawals are a routine administrative procedure.
 “Bodyguards assigned to VIPs are removed or reshuffled from time to time. This is not unique at all,” the officer said.
 "Withdrawal of my security and that of Raila is illegal," said Kalonzo.

 NASA legislators said security teams of the two had to be reinstated within 24 hours failure to which they would initiate mass action.
 ODM chairman John Mbadi said their demands were not negotiable and that should the Government fail to meet them, they would go resort to mass action.
 “President Kenyatta should know that if anything happens to our principals, we shall blame him,” Mbadi said.
