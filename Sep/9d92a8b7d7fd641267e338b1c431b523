More than 1,000 casual workers in the Nandi County Government have been suspended to pave the way for an employee audit.&nbsp; Governor Stephen Sang has formed a task force to establish the roles and terms of service of each casual worker. ALSO READ: County that elected the youngest Governor, Senator and MCA County Secretary Francis Sang confirmed that only casual workers providing essential services in the health department have been retained. &quot;We have temporarily halted the services of over 1,000 casual workers in all departments to pave the way for a human resource audit. Casual workers who are providing essential services have, however, been spared,&quot; said Dr Sang. According to a press release from the office of the governor, the casual workers&#39; task force was charged with ascertaining the number of workers in each department and to establish each worker&#39;s qualifications and remuneration. &quot;The task force shall also identify the vote head under which each casual worker&#39;s source of remuneration is derived,&quot; reads the press release. The task force will also clarify the worker&#39;s recruiting officer, the duration of service, and whether the employee has been properly placed. The suspended workers will know their fate once the human resource needs of each department have been ascertained. The development is aimed at checking the bloated workforce and introducing changes in the working culture. &quot;We clearly have a bloated work force, thus the need for an employee audit to ascertain each worker&#39;s clear role,&quot; said the governor. The county is dealing with employee indiscipline ranging from perpetual absenteeism, rampant lateness, a lacklustre approach in service delivery, and general laxity. &quot;I am in the process of initiating changes in work ethics among employees,&quot; said Sang.
