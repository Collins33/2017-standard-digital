 Officers at the DCI headquarters were ordered to study the clip that captured the said utterances for possible action.
 Police re-arrested the MP moments after his release by a Nairobi magistrate court.
 Police said Mr Owino was to be charged with assault, an offence he allegedly committed when he was vying for the Students Organisation of Nairobi University (Sonu) chairman’s seat last year.
 The MP had just been released on a Sh500, 000 bail and two sureties of Sh1 million each.
 The MP is facing charges of subversion and offensive conduct as well as an alternative charge of incitement to violence.
 The case will be mentioned on Wednesday October 4, 2017.
