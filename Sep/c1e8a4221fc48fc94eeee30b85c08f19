He is said to have committed the offence at Ngong forest, Mutuini place, Dagorreti South Constituency. His lawyer Robert Bosinge requested the court to release him on bail pending the determination of the case. Judge Wakiaga disqualified himself on grounds that he is well known to some of the accused relatives. It is alleged that the deceased, who was staying with her younger brother in Ngara, Nairobi, was scheduled to meet her boyfriend, who she was also meeting for the first time but had promised to be back before the end of the day. The prosecution opposed an application by defense to have the accused released on bail on the grounds that they have strong evidence against the accused since he was the last person to be seen with the deceased. In an affidavit sworn by Isaac Muriuki an officer attached to Special Crime Prevention Unit, upon arrest the accused was able to guard the police to where he had strangled and dumped the body of the deceased.
