Election times in Kenya are political marvels to watch and 2017 stands way above the rest in terms of generating drama. It is a year of many political ups and downs, moments of exhilaration as well as of gloom. While many politicians have influence on selected crowds, one is an unusual constant in Kenya’s political gyrations and has magnetic control over his true believers. Although he does not hold any elected office, Raila Odinga is seemingly so gifted with high capacity for creating national anxiety that he appears to be untouchable.

 The impression that he is untouchable, mostly a 21st Century one, partly arose from the persistent abuse of the word “independence” in the Independent Electoral and boundaries Commission, IEBC. The abuse of the word “independence” was part of generated drama to frustrate IEBC’s work, sometimes through well-orchestrated court injunctions. Besides effort to frustrate the IEBC, there were other political attractions that portended gloom. Party nominations were manufactured disasters as members traded insults inside among themselves and outside directed at rival parties. Officials gave nomination certificates to two different claimants and some ‘losers’ received nomination certificates in some bush rather than in offices.
 After the chaotic nominations, there were exhilarating ups involving exemplary general voter behavior, lining up for hours to vote. While dignitaries and candidates, as expected, tended to get priority to vote without waiting in line, First Lady Margaret Kenyatta defied expectations. She actually has a habit of defying odds and expectations and of setting the global pace for other first ladies. Her marathon feat was unexpected and captured global imagination. She did it again on the voting day. Like other women in her polling station, she patiently and good naturedly lined up for three hours to cast her vote, no privileges. She thus defied the norm for dignitaries and showed good example.

 There was also a lot of attention to few counties either because of the political stakes or because they were amusing. For the first time, women won the governors’ seats in straight political fights. Joyce Laboso whipped Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto. In Kitui, Charity Ngilu enjoyed thrashing Julius Malombe.  Kirinyaga was a contest of two strong women with the man, Joseph Ndathi, relegated to the campaign periphery. Anne Waiguru emerged top but Martha Karua has asked the court to nullify not just the Kirinyaga election but in the entire country. If Karua has her way, those enjoying the perks of being governor are in trouble.
 In Nairobi, Mike Mbuvi Sonko beat Evans Kidero because he knows how to appeal to ordinary people. On being elected, he resuscitated his Sonko Rescue Team to clean up Nairobi and surprised people by diverting the celebration money to pay debts. Other governors-elect then followed Sonko’s lead in diverting celebration money to worthy projects. Among them was the scholarly Peter Anyang Nyong’o whose dreams of making Kisumu a great city were threatened by unruly mobs. Following short election related disturbances, Nyong’o stood out urging rioters not to destroy his county on account of purported developments in Nairobi. The people temporarily listened to him and he succeeded in restoring some normalcy.
 Sycophancy
 New abuses of the IEBC “independence”, giving ultimatum as the IEBC prepares to hold “fresh” elections, imply that NASA does not want the Supreme Court ordered fresh election. Placing obstacles on IEBC “independence” prepares grounds for two eventualities. First would be to petition a “listening” court to nullify the October 17, 2017 election, if it does not go NASA’s way.
 This reality of Raila’s ability to manufacture upheavals, disorganize institutions, and get benefits frequently puts the country on a political rollercoaster. In 2007 there was the slogan “No Raila, No Peace,” and is currently being propped up with assertions that there will be “No Election” despite the Supreme Court order’”.
 Although Raila holds no elective office, he controls the behavior of some elected people who appear to lose “independence” of mind and lapse into subservience. Such people, believing they are beholden to Raila, become willing tools of his schemes to keep the country in a state of constant political anxiety. He benefits from national anxiety. As in 2007 with the “No Raila, No Peace” slogan, the “No Election” slogan is synonymous with civil commotion that would justify the building of a nusu mkate bakery for him to get half-government. This means that the rollercoaster atmosphere is likely to continue beyond October 2017.
