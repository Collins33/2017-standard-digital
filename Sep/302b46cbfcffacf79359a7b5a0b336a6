NAIROBI, KENYA; Nairobi head of traffic has instructed police officers to focus more on motorists with serious offenses as part of measure to clean image of the police department. In an interview with a local online news website, Peter Ndungu warned officers against detaining petty offenders as part of a strategy to deal with corruption and bad image in the service. Moving forward, he instructed traffic officers to issue petty offenders with notices to appear in court at an agreed date. He however warned motorists of arrest failure to honour the notices. The marked vehicles will also be barred from transacting any business with insurance companies and the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA). Motorists with serious offenses will be escorted to police station for processing. Meanwhile, Kenyan motorists will starting next month be able to acquire new digital driving licences as the Government phases out the current paper ones. The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) on Wednesday said the new licences would be available to all new applicants and those seeking renewals, with a complete phase-out of the old ones expected in three years&rsquo; time. &ldquo;Motorists will also find it very convenient and user-friendly since it is the size of a conventional ATM card that you can put in your wallet,&rdquo; said Director General Francis Meja at a press briefing in Nairobi. The new licences are equipped with a biometric chip that will contain information about the motorist for identification purposes. Motorists will also be able to load money on their licences that can be used to settle fines issued on the spot by traffic officers.
