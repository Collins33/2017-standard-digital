He also allegedly said that outsiders residing in Kiambu County would be flushed out and unspecified consequences meted on them. Moses Kuria complained that some 100,000 people in Kiambu voted for the NASA presidential candidate and urged the crowd to look for those opposition voters and present them to him &#39;accompanied by their grandmothers&#39;. He was unhappy that in the Mount Kenya region Raila received 300,000 votes, which he inferred were even more than had been cast for Mr Odinga in Rift Valley. In the Facebook post that went viral and irked some Kenyans, Kuria admitted that he was ready to face the consequences and even stated rhetorically that he was ready to be jailed.
