Most poor households that mainly rely on kerosene for cooking and lighting have also not been spared, with a litre of the commodity to cost them Sh0.94 more from today. Most expensive The price review means that in Nairobi, super petrol will retail at a maximum of Sh98.30, while the same quantity of diesel and kerosene will cost Sh86.86 and Sh64.36 respectively for the next one month. ERC acting Director-General Robert Oimeke said in a statement yesterday the changes are in line with increases in the landed cost of petroleum during the import period. Some 41 out of the 62 major towns in Kenya contained in the ERC pricing guide will buy petrol at over Sh100 per litre, with the commodity being most expensive in Mandera at Sh112.11. The regulator said a litre of super petrol was shipped in at Sh44.11 per litre. However, taxes and levies increased the price by Sh39.04. Dealers and importers will get Sh10.89 on every litre sold. Distribution costs add Sh4.26 to the cost.
