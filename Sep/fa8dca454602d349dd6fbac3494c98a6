The practice involves draping wet soil in a special kind of polythene film to conserve moisture.
 Earlier this month, I visited Kathama, a tiny village in Machakos, where I discovered remarkable farming techniques. This is a novice innovation with great capacity in a water scarce area.

 In Kathama, I connected with one Joseph Mwanzia; an ageing farmer who uses plastic film technology, which he learnt in Ghana.
 He was a happy man. By using the technology, he had increased his maize production three-fold.

 The plastic film technology; also known as plastic mulch technology is an incredibly effective technology which is highly reputed in various parts of the world.
 In China for instance; the plastic mulch technology has been used to cut down cost of production significantly as it effectively suffocates the weeds; thus reducing labour and herbicide use.
 In Africa though; this technology has been more beneficial as a way of effectively managing water stress and other drought related effects.
 The practice, which involves draping wet soil in a special kind of polythene film, increases crop yields incredibly; by conserving moisture; which is then made available for the intended plants to utilize for production.
 In South Eastern Kenya University (SEKU) in Kitui, an experiment involving the use of a special polythene mulch to grow a sample of maize and beans crop reported an incredible increase in productivity.
 Though the technology has many benefits, the challenge is not many farmers are able to access the recommended quality of film.

 Degree of success
 Owing to this, many farmers have been experimenting with different kinds of polythene papers; which have reported a varying degree of success.
 The best news, however, is that irrespective of quality of film used; most farmers have reported a significant increase in crop production.
 The solarisation effect
 Moisture conservation and weed management is however not the only reason many farmers are adopting this technology. The technology; which involves covering of moistened soil in plastic film throughout the production period is also very effective in control of destructive nematodes.
 By the fact that the film-wrapped soil is exposed to the sun for hours; the process of solarisation takes place naturally; controlling the harmful soil borne nematodes; and as such; cutting out a significant cost in crop production.
 For the technology to be successful though; farmers must be keen to ensure that the right amount of moisture is applied in the soil before wrapping it; as no more water should be added into the soil after it is sealed.

 For farmers who prefer to improvise; extra care must be made when making the holes so as to ensure the spacing corresponds carefully with the type of crop one hopes to plant.
