National Super Alliance (NASA) flagbearer Raila Odinga says Jubilee’s ‘rigging’ plans in the now discredited August 8 elections crumbled because they underrated Opposition’s elaborate surveillance plans.
 Raila added that Jubilee fell into NASA’s trap by believing that their parallel vote tallying centre had failed.

 “They actually did not know we had a working tallying centre from where we monitored everything,” Raila said during a campaign rally in Bondo town, Siaya County, Saturday.
 The ODM leader went on: “All along, Jubilee knew we were ill-prepared for the polls. Our tracking system showed some of the results used to declare Uhuru the President were actually being transmitted from inside certain supermarkets.”

 Raila also accused Jubilee leaders of piling undue pressure on Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) Chair Wafula Chebukati to announce the presidential results without results from thousands of polling stations.
 Raila also pointed out how they tricked Jubilee into believing that they would not contest the presidential results at the Supreme Court.
 “All along, we made them believe we would opt for mass action instead of going to court, before pulling a surprise on them,” said Raila.
 Raila, who was accompanied by Siaya Governor Cornell Rasanga, Senator James Orengo and a host of opposition MPs, said he had more supporters across the country than President Uhuru Kenyatta.
 “This is why I was telling Uhuru the other day that I am his senior in politics and age and he should respect me.  We have the numbers and the goodwill. We will beat him in a free and fair election,” the former Prime Minister said.

 The Opposition leader announced he would launch a “No reforms No Election” campaign in Nairobi this week.
 Amid chants of “No Election, No reforms”, from the crowd Raila reiterated that there will be no repeat presidential on October 26 without comprehensive reforms at the IEBC.
 “We are not backing down. Our demands must be met,” he said.
 He added: “We are sending a clear message to IEBC and Jubilee that we are not going to boycott the repeat elections. It will not just happen without reforms. This is not negotiable.”
 He stated that NASA stood for peace and unity and was only calling for fairness and democracy. Raila, who earlier attended the burial of a former Risk Audit manager at Kengen, Maurice Odundo in Ugenya, welcomed back his ally and cousin former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo who took a low profile after being edged out during the ODM nominations.
 “I want every leader from our region to come out and help us campaign. All those who fell must return. This is why I have come with Jakoyo,” said Raila.
 He said he was also reaching out to former Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo. Members of Parliament who were present said they would rally others to support Raila.

 They also said they would thwart any attempt by Jubilee  to pass laws designed to interfere with the independence of the Judiciary and the electoral systems. The MPs  warned  that attempts to recount  the presidential votes  will open a can of  worms.
 “We have no problems with the recounting of the ballots  but we will also insist  on the opening of the KIEM kits and servers  which contain their rigging secrets,” said  Rarieda  MP Otiende Amolo.
 Amolo added: “We hear Jubilee is planning to press for criminal charges against some Supreme Court judges over their ruling. We will also seek to know who gave them the purported evidence they want to use against them.”
 Orengo said President Kenyatta should be ready to vacate office. “He is not bigger than the former presidents,”   said  Orengo. He also took issue with Attorney General Githu Muigai over his interpretation of the Constitution on the Presidency.
 “Githu he is using a Chinese law book instead of Kenyan law book. After 60 days,  Uhuru will not be in office as president of Kenya. Githu has read the law upside down,” said Orengo.
