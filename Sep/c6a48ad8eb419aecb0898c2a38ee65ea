Jubilee governors have warned National Super Alliance presidential candidate, Raila Odinga, against planning a ‘nusu-mkate’ government ahead of the repeat election slated for October 26.
 Led by Nandi Governor Stephen Sang and his Uasin Gishu counterpart Jackson Mandago, the leaders said that Raila’s plan is to cause a constitutional crisis whose aim is to have a power-sharing deal with the Jubilee party.

 The county bosses further asked the former Prime Minister to allow President Uhuru Kenyatta continue with another five years if NASA is not ready for the repeat exercise.
 "He cannot have his way always. He fears defeat. The best thing is for him to give up so that Uhuru takes charge. Raila is always claiming his victory has been stolen come election time. He is not a democrat and should in fact quit politics and let the country move on if he cannot accept the will of the people through the ballot,” Governor Sang said on Saturday.

 Uasin Gishu’s Mandago also said on Friday that the Opposition will not be allowed to disrupt the planned poll as Kenyans will go to the ballot as instructed by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).
 "Kenyans will have to vote as announced by the IEBC. If NASA does not want the election, let them keep off,” stressed Mandago.
 The Uasin Gishu boss also lauded Kenyans for maintaining peace and order despite the political situation in the country.
 
  
 The Opposition has on several occasions said it will boycott the October 26 presidential election if the electoral commission does not address its grievances.
