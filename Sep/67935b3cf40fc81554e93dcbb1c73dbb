 According to Bondo OCPD Paul Kiarie, police were alerted by the bank's operational manager and arrested the student.
 He was found in possession of a bottle containing petrol.
 Preliminary findings revealed he was under investigation by the bank for suspected fraud involving Sh200,000 transferred from a customer's account to his personal account on September 23, 2017.
 The bank also suspected him of fraudulently depositing more than Sh27 million with various M-Pesa operators in Bondo town on diverse dates. The transactions have since been reversed.
 When questioned by the police on why he had attempted to burn the bank, the suspect said he was facing challenges trying to meet his family's needs and was also frustrated at work.
 The bank's corporate affairs manager confirmed the incident but said it was an isolated one.

 "I am yet to get the details of the incident since I have not spoken to him, but I don't think there is any work-related frustration since our employees are well cared for and even those on attachment like him are well remunerated," he said.
