KWS rangers criticised the police officers who shot at the animal, saying this was not the right way to handle the cat. &ldquo;They should have waited for us so that we can sedate the animal and transfer it back to the wild, where it is supposed to be,&rdquo; said one officer. The rangers said it was likely that the animal is a serval cat, not a leopard, and has been spotted in the area before.&nbsp;
