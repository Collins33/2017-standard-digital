Hilda was going about her business unaware that someone had taken pictures of her and she quickly became an internet sensation among Kenyans. Her bold move in carrying what some would consider outdated caught the attention of many Kenyans. &quot;To me I see a very confident girl bearing in mind the ridicule she would get from her peers being a digital generation. She must be commended for being bold,&quot; Gikeri Thomas commented on a Facebook post on Ndungu Nyoro&rsquo;s page. Some people lauded for her courage and creativity, offering to pay her school fees because &lsquo;she fought the odds&rsquo;. Another offered to buy her a backpack. Others called her &lsquo;Wangari Maathai in the making&rsquo; and are even fronting a campaign to get Miss Bundi recognized by NEMA. ALSO READ: How Kenyans are dealing with the plastic bags ban
