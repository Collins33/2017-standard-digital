The National Super Alliance (NASA) presidential candidate Raila Odinga has reiterated that the coalition will not participate in the October 17 election as announced by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), as they have lost faith in the Commission. Raila indicated that President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto will not force the Opposition into the polls with a faulty IEBC.

IEBC messed us up and we cannot entrust our votes to them again,&quot; Raila said. The former Prime Minister also warned the President against threatening the Opposition saying that he lost executive powers after the August 8 General Election. Raila stated that Kenyans are no longer blind and have vowed to elect NASA as the next government. &quot;I want to tell Uhuru to stop threatening me that he is the President. I want to remind him that his powers ended on August 8. He is not Kenya as I also represent many Kenyans and we are not in a dictatorial state,&quot; Odinga stressed. The Opposition chief spoke in a series of rallies in Ewaso Nyiro, Narok town and Ntulele trading center on Saturday.
