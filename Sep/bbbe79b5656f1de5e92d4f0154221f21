National Super Alliance (NASA) presidential candidate Raila Odinga has once again called on Kenyans to fundraise for his campaign ahead of the October 17 repeat presidential election. The NASA leader is asking Kenyans to attend an event dubbed &lsquo;Daughters of Raila Carwash&rsquo; on Saturday (16/09/17) and make his presidency a reality. The event will be held at Luchar Carwash, opposite Uhuru Gardens, Nairobi.

The money was to be contributed via M-Pesa paybill 991444 or Co-operative Bank account name ODM. &quot;People can contribute whatever they can afford even if it is Sh10, Sh100, Sh1 million and much more. This will help us in the campaigns,&quot; Raila indicated. &quot;When you make that contribution you will be buying your ticket to Canaan. The journey is unstoppable, buy your ticket because we are confident we shall reach Canaan,&rdquo; the former PM added. Campaigns for the repeat presidential election officially began on September 6 and will end on October 15. ALSO READ: Uhuru to be sworn in if Raila boycotts elections, Jubilee declares
