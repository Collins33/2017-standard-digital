Hashim said: &quot;Raila Odinga managed to get more votes than President Uhuru Kenyatta in Nairobi in the just concluded elections. This time we want to make sure that the president wins with a big margin&rdquo;. According to results declared by the IEBC, Raila Odinga gathered 834, 032 votes against Uhuru&#39;s 793, 065. The former minority chief whip said the members would be embarking on door to door campaigns across the city, drumming up support for the Jubilee Party leader. Last week, a petition by former Prime Minister, Raila Odinga, led to the invalidation of the presidential election. The Supreme Court directed that IEBC should undertake fresh polls within 60 days. The commission Monday announced that the elections would be held on October 17 but Raila opposed the announcement on the grounds interested parties had not been consulted on the matter.
