 They said street demonstrations will be conducted in all the six counties on Mondays and Fridays, as directed by NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga to press for reforms at the electoral commission ahead of the repeat polls on October 26.
 MPs Jared Okello (Nyando), Fred Ouda (Kisumu Central), Aduma Owuor (Nyakach), Paul Abuor (Rongo) and Samwel Atandi (Alego Usonga) say, they will not relent until their demands are met.

 Kisumu Senator Fred Outa, governors Anyang' Nyong'o (Kisumu), Cornell Rasanga (Siaya) and Okoth Obado (Migori) have concurred. ''We want to make it very clear that No reforms, No elections,'' declared Outa.
 Okello and Ouda said they will not participate in the fresh presidential poll if the calls by NASA to amend flawed sections of the law are not observed. Their decision comes in the wake of preparations by Jubilee legislator to use their numerical strength in Parliament to change the elections laws.
 Some of the proposed amendments by Jubilee which NASA leaders strongly vowed to object are to strip the Judiciary powers to overturn decreed results by returning officers.
 The NASA leaders declared that they will push for equitable amendments of laws that do not favour one side of the political divide but that which will be there for posterity.
 Okello claimed that their rivals are seeking reforms to serve their short-term partisan interests instead of looking at the collective interest of all Kenyans.
