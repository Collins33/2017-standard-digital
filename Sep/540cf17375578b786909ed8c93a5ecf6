The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) has launched investigations into an alleged assault on University of Nairobi students on Thursday by police riot busters.
 “IPOA this morning noted from social media reports of an incident in which members of the National Police Service allegedly stormed the University of Nairobi and assaulted students at the institution,” a statement by Dennis Danson Oketch, Head of Communications and Outreach Department, read in part.

 IPOA announced on Friday that it dispatched the Rapid Response Unit to probe the said attack on students during the pro-Babu Owino demonstrations Thursday.
 The authority says it will analyse the videos circulating online, where General Service Unit (GSU) officers are seen beating students while others can be heard screaming.
