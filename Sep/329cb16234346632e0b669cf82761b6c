Tea farmers in Bomet County are dissatisfied with the bonus released by the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA).
 Some farmers said that although the payment was an increase from last year, it was still below their expectations.

 The farmers claimed they earn less than farmers from other regions and demanded that the prices be harmonised.
 Figures released by KTDA show that farmers supplying green leaf to Momul factory in Konoin will be paid the highest bonus at Sh40 per kilo, with those supplying their produce to Litein factory earning the least at Sh28.80.

 Other factories in the region are Kapkoros at Sh34 per kilo, Mogogosiek at Sh31, Kapset at Sh32, Kapkatet at Sh32.50, and Tegat at Sh30.50.
 Farmers said the prices were only being used to woo them after many of them decided to take their tea to private factories.
 “We will not hesitate to shift fully to these private factories because they offer good prices. Sticking to KTDA will only impoverish us,” said Stephen Koskei from Singorwet.
