Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai suffered severe vomiting after a party meeting and was airlifted from Harare to a Johannesburg hospital, a senior party source said on Saturday. Tsvangirai&rsquo;s condition was currently stable, the source said, adding that the sudden illness did not relate to Tsvangirai&rsquo;s ongoing cancer treatment.

He was taken to hospital on Friday, the source added. Tsvangirai, who leads a broad coalition of opposition parties, is due to challenge his long-time political foe President Robert Mugabe at an election next year.
