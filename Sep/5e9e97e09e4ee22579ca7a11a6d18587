Governor Anne Waiguru has defended her governmentâ€™s decision to fire 469 nurses who defied calls by the Council of Governors to resume duty.
 Speaking while opening the County Assembly on Thursday, Waiguru said she empathised with the grievances of the striking nurses, but stressed on the need to consider that lives have been lost due to lack of medical services.

 "We made it clear to the nurses and gave a date, which has since passed, when they were to return to work as required by law failing which they would be replaced," she said.
 The nurses have been on strike for more than three months, agitating for signing of their CBA.
