This is after they (observer) gave the elections of August 8 a clean bill of health only for the Supreme Court to overturn the presidential election results. Running mate Presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate, Kalonzo Musyoka, while addressing Kajiado County residents, maintained they will boycott the polls if Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) is not overhauled. &quot;The (Ezra) Chiloba team must go home. These were the prime suspects who were involved in the shambolic elections. They should be prosecuted for election offences,&quot; said Mr Odinga. &#39;&#39;We are here to thank you for the overwhelming support you gave us during the recent shambolic election that was cancelled by the Supreme Court following major irregularities. However, we still maintain that we are not ready to participate if the people we mentioned are not fired,&#39;&#39; he added. The two leaders first attended a church service at St Patrick ACK Isinya and later addressed a gathering at Isinya town before taking their campaign to Kitengela. &#39;&#39;I am going to follow closely the case filed by Dr David Nkedianye. We are sure that he was rigged out by the IEBC in favour of Joseph ole Lenku,&#39;&#39; said Raila. Kalonzo urged voters to turn out in large numbers and vote Raila in the fresh election.

On the intimidation of the Judiciary, Siaya Senator James Orengo said that nobody was above the law and warned the President and his deputy to stop threatening Chief Justice David Maraga for giving what they termed an &#39;unfavourable verdict&#39; in the presidential election petition. Raila said foreign observer missions will get a second chance but told them to adhere to international standards and ensure credibility when monitoring the poll. &quot;We will welcome them back to monitor the poll. We will give them a second chance to observe the election but they should be objective in what they do,&quot; Raila said.
