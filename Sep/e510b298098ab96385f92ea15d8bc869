 Raila said they want transparent use of and access to ICT systems and replacement of IEBC officials who bungled the August 8 polls led by IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba.

 “We do not want a computer generated president the way Jubilee has MPs whose victory is questionable,” said Raila.
 He said NASA won the August polls and are committed to send President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto to political oblivion.
 His running mate Kalonzo Musyoka poured scorn at the President for using dirty tricks to lure leaders from Western and Ukambani to State House.
 Kalonzo said Kenyatta was playing political gimmicks with the electorate saying the leaders from Western led by Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka and Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa do not represent the will of voters.
 “The leaders are representing their selfish interests and they will not give Jubilee any votes. In fact the votes he got in Western and Ukambani are computer generated,” Kalonzo said.
 The Wiper leader also asked the Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko to take action against two individuals who hacked the IEBC servers.

 “We are telling Tobiko not to wait for the Supreme Court’s full judgment to prosecute those mentioned in hacking the IEBC servers but to act,” he said.
 NASA presidential chief campaigner Musalia Mudavadi asked the French Government to prosecute directors of Sanfran Group that supplied the Kenya Integrated Management System.
 He said Sanfran Group was working for Jubilee to rig out Raila. Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula pointed President’s hand in Nyeri MP Wambugu Ngunjiri’s petition to ouster CJ David Maraga.
 “You do not need to be a genius to know that it’s Uhuru who instructed the MP to petition the JSC to remove Maraga from office and tell him to withdraw the petition to get cheap political mileage,” said Wetang’ula.
