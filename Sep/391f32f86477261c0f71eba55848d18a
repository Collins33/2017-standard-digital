I know the election was marred with a lot of irregularities since government machinery were used to intimidate my supporters,&quot; said Ruto at a press conference in Nairobi (Monday). He said it was too late for him to go to court to challenge the election. Ruto denied being approached by Jubilee to join the party, saying it was regrettable that most of his agents were chased out of polling centres during the August 8 election. &quot;I am Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) party leader. How can I defect to another political outfit. Jubilee has not approached me but I have seen things blown out of proportion on social media,&quot; he said. Ruto said he conceded defeat but that does not mean the election was free and fair since he did not see a single result from a polling centre signed by his agents. He described himself as a &#39;wounded general&#39; at war, saying NASA is a coalition and that he may decide to join the Opposition campaign rallies or maintain a low profile.
