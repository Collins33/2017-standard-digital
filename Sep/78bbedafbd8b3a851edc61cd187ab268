 “The attempts to prohibit opposition leaders from leaving the country and to control their movement through State House clearances are illegitimate manoeuvres by an increasingly paranoid regime,” said Raila Odinga.
 “We wish to inform the Jubilee administration that our leadership doesnt not intend to seek any clearance from State House to travel abroad. The Kenyan Opposition must remain free as a legitimate part and parcel of the Kenyan political landscape and be allowed and enabled to pursue its mandate as an alternative government and voice of the people in line with the Constitution.”
