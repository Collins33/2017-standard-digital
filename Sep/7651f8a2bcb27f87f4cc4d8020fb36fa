The city centre was briefly brought to a standstill Tuesday evening after demonstrations against Supreme Court judges turned chaotic. Business premises were closed and other activities stopped suddenly as police fired teargas and engaged in running battles with the demonstrators around City Hall.

The petition alleged some of the judges were aligned to the Opposition hence the court&#39;s nullification of the August 8 presidential election. The protest, which began peacefully in the morning with Jubilee supporters demanding a vote recount of the August 8 presidential election, ended in chaos when youths from the Opposition National Super Alliance (NASA) joined in to defend the judges. Petty thieves and pickpockets took advantage of the confusion to steal from unsuspecting members of the public, making away with phones, bags, money and other valuables. Many Nairobians, most of who were trying to get home from work, fell victim to the criminals.
