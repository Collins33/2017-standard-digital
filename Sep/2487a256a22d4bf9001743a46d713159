Former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti has gone to court to challenge Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua&#39;s win in the elections. Ndeti, who was accompanied by her lawyers, arrived at the Machakos law courts around 6 pm and headed to the High Court registry, where she presented her 10,000-page affidavit.

Ndeti, who contested the seat on a Wiper ticket, wants the court to overturn Mutua&#39;s win. Mutua, the Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader, garnered 249,954 votes against Ndeti&#39;s 209,233, according to the results declared by the county IEBC returning officer, Joyce Wamalwa. Ndeti&nbsp;alleges that Mutua&#39;s win was preceded by massive irregularities. She alleges massive rigging that also led to failure to sign forms 37A, 37B, and 37C, as required by law. Ndeti also claims there were non-existent polling centres,&nbsp; culminating in the unlawful declaration of Mutua as the winner of the governorship race. Lawyer Daniel Maanzo told journalists that Ndeti has at least 10 lawyers who will argue her case against Mutua. &quot;Senior Counsel Otiende Amollo will lead a pack of nine other legal minds that will be representing Wavinya in this case,&quot; said Maanzo, who is also the Makueni MP. Maanzo said Wavinya&#39;s lawyers had gathered sufficient evidence to convince the court to nullify Mutua&#39;s win.

He added that Wavinya&#39;s case against Mutua and IEBC was among the most important election petitions by the opposition coalition NASA, which also won a Supreme Court petition that saw President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s win against Raila Odinga overturned. Addressing journalists,&nbsp;Ndeti said she expects justice to be served. Mutua has maintained that he won the election fairly and dismissed claims of irregularities.
