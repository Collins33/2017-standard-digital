Players in the sugar sub-sector have announced a two-million metric tonne deficit in cane supply.
 Releasing a cane census survey, Kenya National Federation of Sugarcane Farmers is predicting tough times ahead for millers if the findings that paint a grim picture of the industry are anything to go by.

 Federation chairman Ibrahim Juma said sugarcane yields dropped drastically from at least 65.5 tons per hectare three years ago to 40 tons by end of last month.
 This could further complicate matters for most struggling local sugar factories.

 Speaking in Kakamega during talks on challenges facing cane farmers, Mr Juma said several sugar factories could shut down if their problems go unresolved.
 Mumias Sugar Company, Nzoia, Muhoroni and Chemilil are already experiencing the effects of the biting shortage.
 Operations have also been suspended at Muhoroni and Chemilil sugar factories due to lack of cane.
 Cane crushed
 The survey indicated a drop in the amount of cane crushed by local millers everyday from 32,000 tons to 6,000 tons. 
 Mr Juma said scarcity of raw material has further triggered a scramble for the little available crop among the existing 12 factories.

 Millers in Western Kenya have been embroiled in a blame game over the poaching of underage crop as the demand for raw material soars.
 In a bid to overcome this challenge, Mumias has established three cane buying centres at Kisoko in Busia, Bumula in Bungoma and Navakholo in Kakamega to reduce cane transport costs, expand the cane catchment area and hasten delivery of cane to the factory using high payload units.
 Last year, the company received 242,605 tonnes of cane through a cane buying centre at Kisoko alone.
 The firm’s chief executive Nashon Aseka has hinted at plans to expand acreage under sugarcane through a proactive farmers’ engagement initiative.
 Kibos and West Kenya sugar factories have also put up cane collection centres in Kakamega and Busia counties, respectively.
 But farmers now want regulations made by industry players gazetted to provide a level playing ground and cushion them from further exploitation.
