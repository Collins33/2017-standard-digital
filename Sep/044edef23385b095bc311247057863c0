Former Nairobi gubernatorial candidate Miguna Miguna has accused the President and his deputy of using draconian methods to change the Constitution.
 Mr Miguna indicated that President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto are using  oppressive means to change the law because the Supreme Court nullified the August 8 General Election.

 “Both President Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto are using DRACONIAN methods of Malaysia's Mahithir in 1988 to subvert the Constitution,” the popular and vocal lawyer posted on his Twitter account on Friday.
  
 
 President Uhuru declared on Thursday that never again would a court of law subvert the will of the people.
 He noted that the court did not scrutinize documents the IEBC used before it as evidence that would have confirmed the credibility of the August election.
 “The outcome was annulled on assumption that there were irregularities on the election forms. It is now manifestly clear, despite election forms being submitted in court, no proper scrutiny or verification of documents took place.
 “I hold our steadfast position that the will of the people of Kenya was subverted by our courts. The Supreme Court owes Kenyans an explanation on how such a monstrous injustice could have taken place,” Uhuru stressed.
