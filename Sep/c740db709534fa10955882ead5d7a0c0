When she was taken to hospital after developing pain in the neck, a doctor said Rehema Katana was suffering from tuberculosis (TB).
 Soon after, the 12-year-old girl developed a swelling in the neck and breathing became a problem as the swelling grew bigger.

 The pain increased as her mother, Betty Katana, desperately sought help.
 Betty says the problem started in December last year when Rehema complained of pain in the neck.

 Her grandmother massaged her thinking she had a muscle strain.
 Her condition worsened at the beginning of this year. “She always came home from school complaining the pain was getting worse,” says Betty.
 The mother of five adds: “My daughter would cry day and night. The pain had become unbearable. Yet I had no money to take he to hospital. It’s been painful to us.”
 Betty says she later got some money and took Rehema to Kilifi general hospital were a doctor took samples.
 “The doctor said results of the sputum were negative while the blood test indicated Rehema had TB,” says a distraught Betty.
 “Later, some friends told me to go to Pathcare hospital in Mombasa for more tests. They said it would be better for fluids that had formed on Rehema’s neck to be drawn from the lump and tested,” said Betty.

 “Since I had no money, I went back to Kilifi General Hospital for a note I would use to solicit for money from well-wishers. The doctor who had attended to her turned us away. He was furious and insisted Rehema had TB. He said I needed to urgently put my daughter on TB drugs,” said Betty.
 Rehema started taking TB drugs in April this year as they were left with any option. “I followed his instructions because he is a specialist,” she says.
 What shocked Betty was that Rehema vomited blood clots, a week after she started taking the drugs. 
 “I took her back to hospital and the doctor told me not to worry, it was just the effect of the drugs. He said I should ensure Rehema continues with her medication and takes a lot of fruits.”
 “A month later, her condition did not improve. I had to take a loan to take her to the private hospital in Mombasa since there were no services in public hospitals due to nurses’ strike.”
 “At Pathcare, doctors took samples and when we went back for results, they told us they had lost the samples. They took new samples.”
 While waiting for the results, Betty went to Khairait hospital hoping to get something to bring down Rehema’s pain and also stop the vomiting of blood which had become regular.

 “My baby had to undergo blood transfusion. The doctors gave me some drugs. The pain and blood vomits stopped. This cost me Sh2,750,” she says.
 It was while at Khairait hospital that a nurse told her of Indian doctors visiting Pandya Hospital in Mombasa.
 “I went and the doctors from Cytecare cancer hospital took three samples. They also did a full body test and confirmed her chest was normal. They also said Rehema did not have TB,” says Betty.
 A doctor at Khairait hospital also confirmed the same to The Standard.
 The latest tests revealed Rehema has lymphoma - a cancer of the lymphatic system that attacks white blood cells known as lymphocytes.
 “The doctors recommended that I take her to a lymphoma specialist for further tests.” Betty is yet to take Rehema to a specialist due to lack of money and she cannot borrow because she owes almost all her friends. 
 “I have been turned away from the hospitals where I have sought help. Some say I love free things. The truth is I have nothing, I just can’t afford the cost of Rehema’s medication. I have borrowed everywhere yet my child’s condition is worsening,” she says.
