MOMBASA, KENYA:  South Coast resort is tapping the new services of Madaraka express to boost domestic tourism in the country.
 On Thursday, Diani Reef Beach Resort and Spa said it has entered into a partnership with train services, Madaraka Express that will see domestic tourists save up to 25 percent by taking a new package with the hotel.

 Dubbed Diani Reef by Train package, the new package that will start effect from Mashujaa day will run up to December this year.
 “We believe that the SGR infrastructure now provides an additional impetus to the tourism sector especially for the domestic tourists who are visiting the coast region. We believe that the 25 percent discounted rate will enable many of the domestic tourists to take advantage of the tourism opportunities within the South Coast and more so to our facility,” says Bobby Kamani, the Managing Director.

 He said that the SGR will boost transport accessibility by even complimenting the almost accomplished Dongo-Kundu bypass that will open up tourism in South Coast:
 “We would like to thank the government for its efforts to improve infrastructural developments in Coast region. We believe this will go a long way in boosting tourism in South Coast. We know that the Dongo-Kundu bypass will be completed in first quarter of 2018 and this will reduce the transport mayhem that has been experienced for many years by tourists having difficulty accessing South Coast via the ferry terminal.”
