Kenyan taxi-hailing firm, Little, which has a partnership with telecoms operator Safaricom, plans to scout for an investor in Silicon Valley next year to help it expand across Africa, its chief executive has said. The one-year-old app has grown to challenge Uber for the top spot in the local market. Little has close to 5,000 drivers who can offer 12,000 rides a day in peak times, Kamal Budhabatti, the CEO said, adding that potentially puts them in second place after Uber.

Our aim is to become the taxi-hailing firm for the continent,&rdquo; Mr Budhabhatti told Reuters. Start operations Little&rsquo;s parent company, Nairobi-based software developer Craft Silicon, has invested $6 million (Sh600 million) in the app. It plans to start operations in Nigeria in a month&rsquo;s time. &ldquo;Nigeria is a big country with a good size population,&rdquo; Mr Budhabatti said in his office, adding that they will then spread into other markets such as Ghana. &ldquo;We are competing with some of the bigger players. If you want to win you can&rsquo;t beat them on capital, you can only beat them on innovations,&rdquo; he said of the Kenyan market, which is also served by Taxify. The features include an SOS button on the app. &ldquo;We call it a panic button,&rdquo; said the CEO. If a customer feels unsafe for whatever reason during their trip and they press the button, they get an escort from the police or a partner security firm within five minutes, he said.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Former Uber CEO says investor lawsuit a 'public and personal attack'
