A petitioner who had challenged the election of Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi’s election has withdrawn his case citing consultation with the community.
 Mr Adow Abikar, an anti-corruption activist and runners up in the Wajir senatorial seat on a PDR ticket through his lawyer D N Gacugia, noted that he no longer wanted to participate in the petition against governor Abdi.
 All the lawyers representing the former governor Abdullahi Ahmed, Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) raised no objection on the withdrawal at the case.
 Abikar in his papers claimed that after consulting with his community members where he was a respectable leader, he had decided to give room for the elected governor to concentrate on working for the people of Wajir.

 "We need to give Governor Mohamed Abdi ample space and time to deliver to the people of Wajir County and other aspirants should come to terms losing elections because the people spoke,” added Abikar.
 Abikar had claimed that governor Abdi used "questionable" academic papers and voting malpractices in the August polls.
 Through his lawyer, Abikar said that he personally travelled to Uganda to verify if his certificate from Kampala University were genuine.
 “The university registry officials told me that the certificates were genuine,” Abikar pointed out.
 The court had on Monday dismissed attempts by Transparency International (TI) to be enjoined in the petition case against Abdi claiming that the affidavit did not meet the threshold.
