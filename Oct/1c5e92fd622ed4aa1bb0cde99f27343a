The push for a clean up at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and the fight against Jubilee government’s dictatorship will not end, National Super Alliance (NASA) presidential candidate Raila Odinga has vowed.
 Raila said for NASA to participate in the forthcoming presidential elections, a level playing ground must be availed.

 He said Jubilee is delaying their victory in the polls by increasing obstacles along the way, citing the new electoral rules introduced in Parliament.
 “We are in the 90th minute of play and our teams are level. The referee says we go for the extra time, and then the other team wants to change rules to suit them. Is it practical?” Raila posed.

 He added, “President Uhuru Kenyatta and Jubilee know very well that if a level playing ground is provided, they can never beat us. They know they lost the last election. And that is why they are in a haste to change electoral laws.”
 The former premier led NASA in a series of campaigns in Vihiga County where he attended a funeral service of the sister to Vihiga senator George Khaniri at Serem, before holding stopovers in Shamakhokho, Mudete, Chavakali and Luanda.
 He also attended a thanksgiving ceremony for Luanda MP Chris Omulele at Mumboha grounds.
 NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi, MPs Alfred Agoi (Sabatia), Ernest Ogesi (Vihiga), Beatrice Adagala (Vihiga Women Rep), Ayub Savula (Lugari) and former Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale were among the leaders who accompanied him. 
 Raila said if going to the streets to force IEBC officials responsible for the bungled election to leave office is the only option, they will pursue that route.
 “We do not fear going to the polls, so long as there is a level playground for all of us,” he said.

 Mr Khaniri noted the journey to Canaan is still unstoppable.
 “If Jubilee are confident of their numbers as they claim, why all the panic and rushing in changing electoral laws, while at the same time buying hunger-stricken politicians from their opponents strongholds?” Khaniri posed.  
 Mudavadi noted the signing of a Sh2.4 billion tender by IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba for the KIEMS kits in the last election is fraudulent.
 “In the last General Election where we had six contestants, only Sh4 billion was used. How comes now that it is only a presidential election, re-run and Sh2.4 billion used? This is mockery of our intelligence,” he said.
 Mudavadi said such issues are the ones making them want IEBC to be cleaned before they go back to polls.
 “How do you explain it when tax payers’ money is used like it is someone’s? We understand the form had threatened to pull out if the tender was not signed. These guys are thieves,” he said.
 Raila noted only Sh800 million is enough to conduct a fresh presidential election and that the surplus is cleverly targeted for corrupt activities.

 Khalwale noted the 18,000 votes that Uhuru got in Vihiga in the August polls, will be reduced sizeably while all the more than 700,000 Kakamega voters will vote for Raila despite a few leaders having decamped to Jubilee.
 “Uhuru is preparing Kenya for war, and that is why we have joined hands with other like-minded leaders from the region to support Raila Odinga who will redeem this country,” Khalwale said.
 Raila is expected to lead NASA campaigns in Kakamega today, before heading to Busia County.
