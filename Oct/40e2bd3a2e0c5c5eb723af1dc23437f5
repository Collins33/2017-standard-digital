 His body was found in one of the drainage trenches at his home with his sweater tied around his neck. He also had a deep cut on one of his arms and his head forced into a trench with stagnant water.
 Though his house had not been broken into, its window panes had been shuttered and had blood stains.

 "He appears to have struggled with his attackers before he died," said Muchiri. Neighbours said they heard his faint calls for help a few minutes past 4.00am.
