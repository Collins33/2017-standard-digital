The Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) and the Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) have differed over proposals to postpone national examinations due to political tension. Knut urged the Government to postpone the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education and the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations. The Homa Bay County Kuppet executive secretary, Stephen Yogo, maintained thatÂ the examinations should go on. The Knut executive secretary for the Rachuonyo branch, Eliud Ombori, argued that some candidates in day schools might miss examinations if political mayhem escalates.
