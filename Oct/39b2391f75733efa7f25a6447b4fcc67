Residents have accused the Ministry of Heath of breaking a promise to supply them with mosquito nets to fight malaria.
 During a recent tour of the region, Health Principal Secretary Julius Korir had said the ministry would supply the affected areas with 106,000 mosquito nets.

 The PS further promised to distribute 7,000 anti-malaria drugs to contain the disease that has killed more than 20 people, mainly children, in Tiaty over the past few weeks.
 But residents said they were yet to see the nets or drugs as the majority continued to suffer.

 “The Government's promise has remained a pipe dream. Not a single mosquito net has been received here,” said Tirioko MCA Sam Lokales.
 "There seem to be re-infection because those who are being treated are getting sick again," he added. "Tiaty is prone to malaria but the county and national governments have never bothered to supply us with mosquito nets."
 Tiaty Health Services Co-ordinator Joseph Nakopir said yesterday it was not clear why the nets had not been procured.
 "The Government had promised mosquito nets but to date, not a single one has been received," he said.
 Meanwhile, 70 people from Maji Tamu village in Emining have contracted Hepatitis B. 
 Area MCA Paul Kibarar said most of the patients had not been treated due to the nurses' strike.
