A resident from Homa Bay County has set tongues wagging after her passionate elocution on why she did not participate in the repeat presidential election on Thursday.
 When asked by KTN’s reporter Timothy Otieno why she did not vote in the fresh presidential poll, the passionate woman went ballistic and said that she voted in the August 8 General Election and that was final.

 President Uhuru Kenyatta has taken an early lead in several constituencies, even as the IEBC continues to tally votes cast in the October 26 repeat Poll.
 Kenyans took to the poll on October 26th following a Supreme Court ruling which nullified the August 8 presidential poll on grounds that IEBC committed various illegalities during the poll process.
 In the September 1 verdict, the Court ordered the poll body to conduct a repeat poll within 60 days, in accordance with the law. National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition withdrew from the repeat poll after IEBC failed to meet its irreducible minimums, citing that the election would not be free and fair.
 Raila urged supporters to boycott the poll, even as Uhuru's team asked voters to come out in large numbers for the election. IEBC has seven days to declare the winner, even as debate rages over the credibility of the poll.
