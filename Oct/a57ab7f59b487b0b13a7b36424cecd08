Thirdway Alliance presidential candidate Ekuru Aukot has hit out at Opposition leader, Raila Odinga, eight days to the repeat election scheduled to take place on October 26.
 He said on Monday that Raila represents past politics and such should be routed out for the good of the country.

 Dr Aukot added that he does not care what the National Super Alliance (NASA) presidential candidate thinks of him.
 He vowed that he will participate in the fresh poll and Raila will not stop him.

 “Raila represents the past, the kind of politics we want to rout out. This country is for all of us in equal measure. I would never want to respond to people who communicate nothing in huge crowds.
 “I don’t care what he thinks (Raila Odinga), he won’t stop me,” stressed Aukot.
 He, however, maintained that changes and reforms must be effected to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) before the much-anticipated poll.
 The former Prime Minister had on Sunday called Aukot a traitor and asked the woman in his life to divorce him.
 Raila made the remarks at a rally at Mama Ngina grounds in Mombasa County, just hours after he returned from a trip in the United Kingdom.

 Aukot wants the IEBC to include all candidates who participated in the August 8 presidential election in the October 26 repeat poll.
 He said the country needs to move on since the fresh poll can’t stop due to Raila’s withdrawal.
 Initially, the Thirdway Alliance presidential candidate wanted to file a petition seeking to bar inclusion of other presidential candidates in the repeat poll.
 This was after a High Court ruling on Wednesday (October 11) that allowed IEBC to include his name in the poll.
