Jubilee Party officials from Shinyalu have claimed that their lives are in danger after allegedly receiving death threats. The officials, led by Shinyalu party chairman Benedict Sabala, said they started receiving the threats when they went to cast their votes on October 26 during the repeat presidential poll. “We knew some leaders from the Opposition were planning to attack us and we informed the security agencies, but no action was taken,” Mr Sabala said. He added that the threats indicated their fingers would be chopped off, especially the one that was marked with indelible ink after voting. "We have received threats that our houses will be burnt. This has prompted us to send our wives and children into hiding as we wait for the situation to cool down. Also, election officials alerted our opponents on how we voted, which saw youths attack us at Khayega market,” he said. Patrick Anguba, who was a Jubilee agent at Khayega Primary School, said he was roughed by the youths, who pelted him with stones for allegedly betraying the community by supporting the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. “They took my phone worth 10,000, wallet, Sh650, and personal documents. They even threatened to unzip me. They also came with kerosene and lit bonfires,” he said.
