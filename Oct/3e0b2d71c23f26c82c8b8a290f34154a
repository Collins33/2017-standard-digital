The Opposition alliance has given the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) 72 hours to charge Jubilee Party agent Davies Chirchir with a list of electoral offences.
 Through lawyer Anthony Oluoch, the National Super Alliance (NASA) has drafted four complaints against Mr Chirchir, who was President Uhuru Kenyatta’s chief agent at the Bomas of Kenya National Tallying Centre.

 The alliance also wants six Safaricom employees they claim interfered with the August 8 presidential election charged.
 The alliance stated that if DPP Keriako Tobiko did not act within 72 hours, it would commence a private prosecution against Chirchir in accordance with Section 28 of the Office of the DPP Act, which allows private prosecution of individuals.

 Chirchir said he did nothing illegal as the IEBC gave him rights as an agent just like other agents.
 “If they have to sue, let them sue even their own agents,” Chirchir said.
 This was the second time the Opposition was giving the DPP an ultimatum to prosecute individuals it claims interfered with the August 8 polls.
 File charges
 The first came on September 22, when NASA asked Mr Tobiko to file charges against Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) officials accused of bungling the polls.
 The alliance has stated that it does not trust the IEBC officials to be part of the October 26 repeat presidential election.
