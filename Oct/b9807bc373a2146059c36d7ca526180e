2NK Matatu Sacco has denied reports circulating online that they have slashed their fares from Nyeri to Nairobi to Sh40.
 A widely shared photo of a 2NK matatu indicated that the company had reduced the fares, usually Sh300, with the hope that more people could travel upcountry.

 Below the photo was the caption "When our brothers in Central Kenya say Kumira Kumira, they mean it. Now 2NK Sacco have reduced their fare charges to Sh40 from Nairobi"
 Kumira Kumira is a slogan adopted by some politicians in the area to push for a bigger turn out on October 26.

 However, the matatu operators have branded the reports as fake and indicated that their fares will remain constant.
 A number of citizens who rushed to the matatu stage turned away disappointed after they were informed that the photograph was a hoax.
