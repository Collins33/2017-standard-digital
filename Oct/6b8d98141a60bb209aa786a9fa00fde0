Thirdway Alliance presidential candidate Ekuru Aukot has asked Opposition leader, Raila Odinga, to endorse him ahead of the repeat poll scheduled to take place on October 26.
 Aukot indicated on Tuesday that Raila should support him to enable him defeat President Uhuru Kenyatta in the much-anticipated fresh election.

 "As a matter of fact, I wouldn't mind if Raila supported me now that he is not interested in the election. It is the only fair way to remove Uhuru from power. I'll talk to him and I will be happy if he endorses my candidature,” Aukot pointed out.
 Aukot had on Monday (October 16) said that Raila represents past politics and such should be routed out for the good of the country.

 Dr Aukot added that he does not care what the NASA presidential candidate thinks of him.
 He vowed that he would participate in the fresh poll and Raila would not stop him.
 “Raila represents the past, the kind of politics we want to rout out. This country is for all of us in equal measure. I would never want to respond to people who communicate nothing in huge crowds.
 “I don’t care what he thinks (Raila Odinga), he won’t stop me,” stressed Aukot.
 He, however, maintained that changes and reforms must be effected to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) before the much-anticipated poll.
 The former Prime Minister had on Sunday (October 15) called Aukot a traitor and asked the woman in his life to divorce him.
