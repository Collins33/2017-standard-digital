 Salesio Thuranira, a member of the Jubilee Party County Election Board (Meru chapter), said they would challenge the list since female MCAs were overlooked.
 “The gender rule has not been met. Gacheri Muthuri (nominated) is the only female MCA who has been selected as chairperson of the Cohesion committee... We are consulting lawyers with a view to challenging the list in court,” said Thuranira.

 But Majority Leader Victor Mutuma and MCAs Kithinji (Nyaki East) and Makena Muthaura (nominated) defended the selection, saying there was gender parity.
 Mr Mutuma (Athwana) noted 97 per cent (43) of elected MCAs were men while 19 out of the 23 nominated ones are women.
 “We have a good number of ladies as vice chairpersons and there is gender quality in composition,” said Mutuma.
 Ms Muthaura brushed off allegations of gender inequality and accused those against the list of playing politics.
 Finance Committee will be chaired by Julius Mbijjiwe of PNU while his party colleague Romano Mwito will chair the Water committee.
 Other are Jubilee Party's Robert Kithinji (Economic, Physical Planning and ICT), Mwirigi Karinga (Education) and King’ori Kajana (Transport Committee).
