 Miguna also indicated that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has not been restructured and officials that allegedly bungled the August 8 General Election have not been prosecuted.
 The IEBC hasn't been restructured and the electoral fraudsters punished and/or banished. President Uhuru Kenyatta is already rigging,” the popular and vocal lawyer stated in a tweet.

 President Uhuru dismissed calls by the NASA coalition for a caretaker government if the much anticipated showdown is not held within 60 days.
 The Head of State noted on Saturday that he will continue serving as President until a new leader is elected and sworn into office.
 “There will be no such thing as a ‘nusu-mkate’ government, not even a slice. There is no place for a coalition government in our Constitution, where a few people sit in a room and decide how the positions will be dished out to individuals,” the President declared.
 The President was addressing delegates from Western Kenya at Approved School in Kakamega County.
 He was accompanied by the Deputy President William Ruto and other Jubilee leaders in the vote hunting mission.
