 Witnesses said that he had not participated in the blocking of the road a few metres away and was shot without reason.
 Earlier police had been engaging residents in a cat and mouse game in the town.
 Residents had blocked the Bungoma-Mumias highway and the entrance to the main bus stop by lighting bonfires.
 The residents then started fleeing once the police showed.
 Bungoma County Police Commander, Charles Munyoli, said he had not received information on the shooting and would give a report once he was made aware of it.
 The chase went on for about two hours before the demonstrators dispersed.
