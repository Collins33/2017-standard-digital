The KCB Foundation has launched a container-based franchise model to support beauty and personal care businesses.
 The modified shipping container will be retrofitted to host a beauty salon and will act as an incubation hub for students who have completed hair and beauty courses to perfect their professional skills.
 The launch coincided with the graduation of 316 beneficiaries under the foundation’s 2jiajiri programme, a skill development and wealth creation project that seeks to develop a new cadre of youthful entrepreneurs in the informal sector to ease the country’s unemployment crisis.
 The salon suites concept, also known as booth rentals, is one of the fastest-growing segments in the hair and beauty industry.
