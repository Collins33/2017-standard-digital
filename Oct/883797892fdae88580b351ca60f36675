 Dr Muturi said they suspect the cholera outbreak was caused by consumption of contaminated water.
 Muturi said they have appointed a team of experts who are testing water from different rivers in the county to establish whether the water is contaminated with the bacteria.
  "We have sent samples to government chemist for testing to confirm the contamination," he said.
 Muturi said doctors will tour the homes of all patients who are admitted to establish their sources of water and put measures to curb the spread.
 Muturi had on Sunday announced that the county government had banned food hawking and mass feeding in social gatherings as health officials try to curb down the situation.
  This was after three patients tested positive to the cholera bacteria.

 He said they are working in collaboration with the national government to make sure people will abide to the instruction laid out to prevent more death.
 He assured the residents that the situation will be managed by their team of doctors who are working round the clock bring the health situation in the county back to normal.
