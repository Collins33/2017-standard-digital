The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has given Al Ghurair the green light to print ballot papers for the fresh presidential election.
 IEBC resolved to return to the Dubai-based firm after the National Treasury blocked its bid to procure the strategic materials through a UN development agency.

 On Saturday, IEBC vice chairperson Connie Maina confirmed that Al Ghurair had received the printing order after Opposition and Jubilee failed to reach a consensus.
 “Both NASA and Jubilee have rejected the proposal. With limited options, the commission had to proceed in readiness for the October 26 elections. We are also running out of time. We are already in discussion with Al Ghurair to supply the ballot papers within the framework of the existing two-year contract,” Ms Maina said.

 Last week, IEBC wrote to The Treasury and explained that it had struck a deal with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to shop for a new supplier as a compromise following demands from Opposition leaders.
 In the deal, the UNDP was to identify a new printer to deliver the ballot papers and statutory forms at least four days to the D-day.
 The UN agency was also to meet the entire cost through its programme dubbed, ‘Strengthening the electoral process in Kenya’, which would be a relief to tax payers.
 IEBC says although it has a framework contract with Al Ghurair, the offer by UNDP was a welcome relief as it would have helped it regain public confidence that has been eroded following the nullification of the last presidential election.
 “The commission has a financing agreement with UNDP, and in accordance to this agreement, has offered to procure ballot papers and the result forms. This assistance is meant to aid restore public confidence and trust in the integrity of the ballot papers and result forms, as well as address concerns raised by the Supreme Court,” IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati wrote.
 In the letter addressed to NASA secretariat CEO Norman Magaya, the IEBC boss said he had written to the National Treasury to seek advice on the engagement with UNDP with regard to the offer, following a resolution of the commission’s plenary and was then waiting for a feedback.

 However, the proposal which had already received opposition from both NASA and Jubilee was shot down by The Treasury which wrote to IEBC emphatically rejecting the deal.
 “We wish to confirm you that the National Treasury provided adequate funding to IEBC in the financial year 2016/17 budgets to finance the national elections, including procurement of necessary materials and equipment. In addition, we have further provided Sh10 billion in the Supplementary Budget to cover the cost of the fresh presidential elections. We, therefore, do not consider it necessary to seek further support in this regard,” Treasury PS Kamau Thuge wrote to IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba.
 On Thursday, Chebukati confirmed that the commission was in receipt of the objection from The Treasury and will hold a plenary to deliberate on the way forward.
 Yesterday, a member of the commission told the Sunday Standard that "our marriage with Al Ghurair is unbroken" in reference to the existing framework contract in place.
 NASA had indicated that depriving Al Ghurair of the deal is part of its ‘irreducible minimums’ demands for them to take part in the repeat polls.
