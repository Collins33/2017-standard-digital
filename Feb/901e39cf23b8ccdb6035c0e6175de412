Norway has joined an international initiative to raise millions of dollars to replace shortfalls left by U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s ban on U.S.-funded groups worldwide providing information on abortion. In January, the Netherlands started a global fund to help women access abortion services, saying Trump&#39;s &quot;global gag rule&quot; meant a funding gap of $600 million over the next four years, and has pledged $10 million to the initiative to replace that. Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg, Finland, Canada and Cape Verde have all also lent their support. &quot;The government is increasing its support for family planning and safe abortion by 85 million Norwegian crowns ($10 million) compared with 2016,&quot; Prime Minister Erna Solberg said. &quot;At a time when this agenda has come under pressure, a joint effort is particularly important,&quot; he said in a statement. Last month, Trump reinstated a policy requiring overseas organizations that receive U.S. family-planning funds to certify they do not perform abortions or provide abortion advice as a method of family planning.
