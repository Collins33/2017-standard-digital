Mbeere South MP Mutava Musyimi has turned down an offer by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to join the party. Mr Musyimi said while he appreciated the gesture, he was comfortable in Jubilee and would use it to defend his seat.

He said this was because Mwea people voted overwhelmingly for the Cord presidential candidate in 2013. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Is Musila set to ditch Wiper Party?
