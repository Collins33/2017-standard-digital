A case in which Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma is accused of assaulting one of his political opponents failed to proceed Monday after the prosecution told the court that the MP&#39;s fingerprints had not been taken. Mr Kaluma will now know in 10 days whether his fingerprints will be taken before the case can proceed to full hearing. He is accused of assaulting political aspirant Washington Ogaga. The court was told that on November 27, 2016, at Homa Bay Stadium, the MP wilfully and unlawfully assaulted Mr Ogaga, causing him actual bodily harm. Kaluma is out on a Sh20,000 cash bail. Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Ammon Ojwang&#39; Monday filed an application to stop the case from proceeding before the MP&#39;s fingerprints are taken by the police. Mr Ojwang&#39; submitted that Kaluma had violated the terms and conditions under which he was released on bond. &quot;Police Service Act, 2011 empowers officers to take the fingerprints of suspects in their custody. The MP did not present himself to the police, as was agreed when he was awarded the bond,&quot; said Ojwang&#39;. Kaluma&#39;s lawyer Samuel Nyauke opposed the application. The court will rule on the matter on March 3.
