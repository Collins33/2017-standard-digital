Clearing agents have demanded that a lifestyle audit be conducted on all Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) employees. In a statement yesterday, the Kenya International Freight and Warehousing Association (KIFWA) said any attempt to vet agents again &ldquo;must be preceded by a fresh vetting/lifestyle audit of the KRA employees by an independent body&rdquo;. The association also called off a go-slow announced last week to protest against new guidelines issued by KRA. The taxman wants agents to provide additional information to exhibit tax compliance and transparent operations before their licences can be renewed. KIFWA also revealed a new management team to conduct talks with the revenue agency. &ldquo;Engagements with stakeholders will only be done through a nine-member task force led by Dr Chris Bichange and Moges Andae, who are forthwith given the mandate to spearhead consultations to address the outstanding issues that have led to the current state of affairs,&rdquo; read the statement from Wycliff Wanda, KIFWA&rsquo;s executive director.
