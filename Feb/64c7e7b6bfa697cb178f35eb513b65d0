Kilifi Deputy Governor Kennedy Kamto has ditched the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) for Jubilee Party (JP). Kamto, who has had frosty relations with Governor Amason Kingi, yesterday said he quit in search of democracy in JP. &ldquo;I was among the top decision makers in ODM, but I have decided to jump ship because there is no democracy in ODM. You have to swear allegiance to some people in Kilifi if you want to be in ODM,&rdquo; said Mboja, who has been Kilifi ODM branch chairman. She said the party had promoted dictatorship and announced intention to be Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro&rsquo;s running mate in the gubernatorial race in August. &ldquo;I suffered under Governor Kingi&rsquo;s leadership. Most of my supporters have been asking why I did not leave earlier but I had to stay so that I could gather enough evidence to expose the rot in the county. I have a lot of information and I am ready to challenge any of the leaders in Kingi&rsquo;s government,&rdquo; said Kamto. Kamato was received by Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya and Mung&rsquo;aro yesterday at the Dr Kraft Centre in Rabai in Kilifi County where the leaders had a rally. Mvurya claimed the National Super Alliance is composed of &ldquo;failures&rdquo; that have not served the interest of Coast residents and asked the electorate to embrace Jubilee. Other ODM lieutenants who defected include long time ODM National Executive Council member Grace Mboja, Rabai/Kisurutini MCA Kenga Mupe, Dan Chome who lost ODM nomination in the Malindi by-election last March and Kilifi senatorial aspirant Ken Nyale.
