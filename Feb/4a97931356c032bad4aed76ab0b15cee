Tharaka Nithi Governor Samuel Ragwa, his deputy Eliud Muriithi and 15 Assembly Members have ditched Jubilee Party and joined Narc-Kenya. Mr Ragwa and his supporters claimed they have ditched President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election vehicle &lsquo;after it became apparent that the party could not guarantee them a fair nomination process&rsquo;. However, the Governor supported Martha Karua&rsquo;s sentiments that they will support President Uhuru&rsquo;s re-election bid in the August 8 General Election. He said while they were determined to go into the nominations under JP, recent events within the party had given indications that despite the numerous pledges, there are fears that the party primaries would not be free and fair. &ldquo;We no longer see the promise of a fair nomination in JP as we expected. We also do not have a guarantee that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission will undertake the primaries. It is for the reason that we decided to seek re-election through a different vehicle,&rdquo; he said. Receiving the defectors, Ms Karua said Narc-Kenya had declared that it will be supporting Uhuru re-election. ALSO READ: Karua told to abandon Kirinyaga gubernatorial bid for Waiguru
