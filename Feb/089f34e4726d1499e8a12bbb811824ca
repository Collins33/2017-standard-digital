Cartoonists have promised to mentor&nbsp;Ian Mwaura Njenga, a student who was expelled from school for his drawings. Through Harrison Munene Muriuki, who works for The Standard Group as a cartoonist, the East Africa Cartoonist Society, Katuni, said this is aimed at motivating the student and building his talent. &quot;We were very saddened by the turn of events and we promise to mentor the boy once he clears his high school studies.&quot; Mr Muriuki said. &quot;Ian&#39;s drawings portrayed pure talent, a very imaginative mind, and love for art. As the organisation that takes care of the welfare of cartoonists across East Africa, we will recruit Ian to join our vibrant team of artists,&quot; he added. He said the organisation would ensure that the student&#39;s work is showcased in different platforms and published in newspapers. Mr James Kamawira, the&nbsp;society&#39;s chairman, criticised the expulsion.

This should not be happening in this time and place and we would not want to see this repeated in any other institution of learning,&quot; he said. The society decried the talent that has gone to waste since academics started dominating in school. &quot;This does not bode well for the efforts of stakeholders in the education sector to have artistic talent recognised and mainstreamed in institutions of learning. There is a massive pool of talent in many forms in our schools that is going to waste simply because academic prowess has been put before everything else,&quot; the statement reads. Mr&nbsp;Kamawira said the student&#39;s expulsion paints a disturbing picture of how art is viewed in a society that has sacrificed talent at the altar of academic endeavour. Muriuki said he hoped that the&nbsp;2-6-3-3-3 education system, which is set to replace the 8-4-4 system, will address such matters. &quot;We are hopeful that this system will help students to develop their talents,&quot; he said. Ian was expelled by the school&#39;s disciplinary committee for what it termed &quot;demonic faith&quot;.
