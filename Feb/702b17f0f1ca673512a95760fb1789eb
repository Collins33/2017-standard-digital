The late Boy Juma Boy&#39;s family has picked Issah Juma Boy to succeed him. Mr Issah, who is Boy&#39;s younger brother, has also been endorsed by elected leaders including Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori, County Assembly Speaker Sammy Ruwa and several MCAs. During a meeting in Gasi village, the leaders and family members vowed to retain the seat in the upcoming elections. &quot;As a family, we have decided that Issah, the younger brother of the late Boy, will succeed him. We have also sat with Orange party leaders and with their support, our brother will run on an ODM party ticket,&quot; said Buhiri Juma Boy, the family spokesman, yesterday. Mr Buhiri said just like Boy, the family would remain intact and steadfast in the Opposition party. Issah is not new to politics - he ran for the Matuga parliamentary seat on a Kadu Asili party ticket in 2007 but failed.

Mr Dori said Issah&#39;s election would be a good send-off for the late senator. &quot;Because Boy stood with the party and fought for it, we ask our party leaders to give the family special consideration,&quot; he said. Dori argued that it was not the first time for family members to succeed those that have died. &quot;We are not the first people to do it,&quot; he said.
