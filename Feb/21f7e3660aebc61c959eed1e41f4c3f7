The Communication Authority has refuted&nbsp;claims of spying on mobile phone usage through installation of new systems. Director General Francis Wangusi clarified that the targets are counterfeit devices as CA does not have the spying capacity. In an earlier directive on SIM lines, the authority pointed out that information will be kept confidential by Mobile Service Providers in a secure data base. The information collected should not be disclosed to any person unless as required by any written law.
