MPs are divided on plans to register Kenyans in the diaspora to vote in the August 8 elections. Members of the Parliamentary Committee on Delegated Legislation who are meeting the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) in Mombasa are split on the issue, with those from the Opposition expressing fears that Jubilee government might use the diaspora vote to rig the elections. IEBC had announced plans to begin voter registration for Kenyans living in East Africa and South Africa for the next 14 days starting yesterday. But Ruaraka MP Tom Kajwang, who spoke to The Standard at the Serena Beach Resort yesterday, said Kenyans in the diaspora should travel back to the country if they wish to participate in the elections. &quot;We are strongly opposed to Kenyans voting outside the country,&quot; he said. Kinango MP Gonzi Rai cautioned the Opposition against spreading mistrust in the upcoming polls.
