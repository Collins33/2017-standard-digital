Maendeleo Chap Chap leader Alfred Mutua&nbsp;said many people within the Jubilee administration were frustrating President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s commitment to fight corruption. &quot;I know the President as a selfless leader who is trying a lot to fight graft. Those letting him down are in the Government,&quot; said Mutua during his two-day tour of Coast. The Machakos governor toured Kilifi on Saturday and was in Kwale yesterday to popularise his party. On Saturday, Mutua urged Kilifi residents to support Maendeleo Chap Chap saying it is the only party which is committed to the interests of common Kenyan who want to see economic development. And speaking in Ukunda yesterday, Mutua urged voters to elect leaders of integrity during the forthcoming elections.
