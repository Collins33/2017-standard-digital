Senator John McCain, defending the media against the latest attack by President Donald Trump, warned that suppressing the free press was &quot;how dictators get started&quot;. The Arizona Republican, a frequent critic of Trump, was responding to a tweet in which Trump accused the media of being &ldquo;the enemy of the American people&rdquo;. The international order established after World War Two was built in part on a free press, McCain said in an excerpt of an interview with NBC&#39;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that was released in advance of the full Sunday morning broadcast. &quot;I hate the press. I hate you especially,&quot; he told interviewer Chuck Todd from an international security conference in Munich. &quot;But the fact is we need you. We need a free press. We must have it. It&#39;s vital.&quot; &quot;If you want to preserve - I&#39;m very serious now - if you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and many times adversarial press. And without it, I am afraid that we would lose so much of our individual liberties over time. That&#39;s how dictators get started,&quot; he continued. &quot;They get started by suppressing free press. In other words, a consolidation of power. When you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press. And I&#39;m not saying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator. I&#39;m just saying we need to learn the lessons of history,&quot; McCain said.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized the importance of a free press at the conference on Saturday, saying, &quot;I have high respect for journalists. We&#39;ve always had good results, at least in Germany, by relying on mutual respect.&quot;
