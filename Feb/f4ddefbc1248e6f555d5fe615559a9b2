Kanu will not field candidates for Bungoma and Trans Nzoia gubernatorial seats and will instead support Ford Kenya candidates. The party, however, will field candidates for other seats in the two counties. Job Shangani, Trans Nzoia and Bungoma Kanu regional coordinator, predicted that the independence party will win majority seats in the two counties. Speaking in Bungoma after a meeting with Ford Kenya officials, Shangani said Kanu may also support Ford Kenya senatorial aspirants. He added that Ford Kenya would pick Kanu member for deputy governor post. &quot;The talks are still ongoing. This arrangement is the best because Ford Kenya is popular in Bungoma and already it has gubernatorial aspirants who have announced their intentions to unseat governor Ken Lusaka,&quot; he said.
