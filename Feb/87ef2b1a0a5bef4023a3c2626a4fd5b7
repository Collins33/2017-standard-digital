Imenti Central MP Mwiti Irea has blamed Senator Kiraitu Murungi for &#39;misadvising&#39; President Uhuru Kenyatta on formation of Jubilee Party. Mr Irea said dissolving parties was a monumental mistake as it amounted to killing the democratic space that Kenyans fought for. The MP said the senator&#39;s admission that dissolution of parties was premature means he failed to read the mood of Kenyans. &quot;Kiraitu was one of the people who fought for repeal of Section 2A leading to political pluralism that culminated in formation of many parties with diverse ideologies. But dissolution of parties is bound to stifle the democratic space we have been enjoying,&quot; Irea, who bagged the seat on Senator Kiraitu&#39;s Alliance Party of Kenya, said in Meru town on Sunday.
