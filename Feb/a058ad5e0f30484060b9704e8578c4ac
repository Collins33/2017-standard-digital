Governor Evans Kidero has said he is not scared of Jubilee Party in the gubernatorial race. He said he is not bothered by any alignments in JP. &ldquo;Let them sort out their issues and present their candidate because as the incumbent, I&rsquo;m ready. Let them bring the strongest person and I will beat them hands down,&rdquo; he said. Dr Kidero&rsquo;s remarks came just a day after a section Jubilee politicians calling themselves &lsquo;Team Nairobi&rsquo; that brings together Senator Mike Sonko, Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru, former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru and Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja said they unveil their candidate on tomorrow. He was speaking Saturday when he toured the city&rsquo;s Eastlands suburbs.
