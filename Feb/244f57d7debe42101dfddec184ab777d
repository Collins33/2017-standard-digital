There is still no headway in the renewed talks to have doctors back to work after both sides in the conflict maintained their hard-line stands. This is despite both parties; doctors and Government, remaining with two days to submit a report to the court on the progress of the talks for further directions. The above requirement was part of the conditions reached upon after consent was agreed between the doctors&#39; lawyers and the Council of Governors that facilitated the release of the union officials. Sources privy to the discussions said the Government was still pushing for a return to work formula and not a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) still maintains that it will be settling for nothing less than a CBA. KMPDU Chairman Samuel Oroko said they will tighten their demands following their &#39;unfair&#39; one month jail term that lasted just 26 hours.

It is not our fault that for 54 years, the Government of Kenya has neglected public healthcare,&quot; said Dr Oroko. He added: &quot;I want to make it clear that we only have one objective in this strike; CBA implementation in full. Nobody should be allowed to change this.&quot; The Government, in a statement from State House spokesman, Manoah Esipisu, said it is supportive of the ongoing negotiations to end the strike. Mr Esipisu assured Kenyans that the Government is fully engaged in efforts to reach a truce with the doctors. &quot;Council of Governors and the doctors have continued negotiations throughout the weekend in order to meet a timeline to report on progress,&quot; he said.
