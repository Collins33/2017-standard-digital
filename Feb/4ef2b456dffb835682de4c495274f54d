National Lands Commission (NLC) chairman Mohamed Swazuri has said the contentious boundary dispute between the Maasai and Kipsigis communities living in Trans Mara East/West constituencies would be solved in 14 days. Dr Swazuri, who was accompanied by NLC commissioners to the disputed region on Friday, used the original maps of 1973 for Shartuka and 1982 for Njipiship to identify the actual boundaries to solve the dispute that arose late last year. Representatives of the two groups were present. His visit comes at a time when violence has left about 15 people dead and 50 houses torched. Swazuri said the government has not changed the border&rsquo;s map and that all irregularly allocated title deeds will be revoked. &ldquo;We have gone round the border with lands adjudicators, surveyors and we have seen the reality. We are going to analyse our findings and in two weeks&rsquo; time we shall give our decision,&rdquo; he said. ALSO READ: Give us land titles, residents plead
