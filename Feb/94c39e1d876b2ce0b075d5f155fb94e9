A parliamentary aspirant from Bomet has said Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi is best placed to be National Super Alliance (NASA) flag bearer. Bomet Central parliamentary aspirant Gilbert Rono said NASA will reap big in Rift Valley if it settles on Mudavadi.&nbsp; Rono who is allied to Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto&#39;s Chama Cha Mashinani party said it will be an uphill task to sell ODM leader Raila Odinga as NASA flag bearer. &quot;This is free advice to NASA... Musalia Mudavadi is more appealing and will be easy to sell to voters in the region,&quot; Rono told the press in Bomet.
