The Political Parties Tribunal&nbsp;has overturned the decision by the Orange Democratic Party (ODM) to expel Ababu Namwamba and Masoud Mwahima Mwalimu. The tribunal, at the same time, upheld the expulsion of Governor Salim Mvurya Ngala, MPs Joash Maangi, Isaac Mwaura, Steve Kariuki, John Waluke, Samuel Arama and Zainab Chidzuga. The panel ruled that Namwamba and Masoud were not granted a fair hearing because they did not face a disciplinary committee before their expulsion. The decision to expel the &#39;rebels&#39; was allegedly reached after they were found guilty of attending the launch of the Jubilee Party at the Kasarani Stadium on September 10. The tribunal was chaired by Kyalo Mbobu.
