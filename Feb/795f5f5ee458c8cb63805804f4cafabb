The election of Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed as Somalia president received a lot of support from within and outside Somalia. There could not have been greater acceptance of President Mohamed than the attendance of three heads of state; Kenya&rsquo;s Uhuru Kenyatta, Djibouti&rsquo;s Omar Guelle and Ethiopia&rsquo;s Prime Minister Haile Mariam Desalegn to witness his swearing-in despite the fragile security situation, what with Al Shabaab on the prowl. Somalia has gone through turbulent times since the ouster of President Siad Barre in 1991, after which the country descended into chaos from which it has been near impossible to extract itself. Regional efforts to bring stability to Somalia over the years have all hit brick walls. Inter-clan fights have conspired to deny the horn of Africa country internal peace. But there comes a time when humanity becomes tired of wars in which nobody is the victor, and Somalia is at that point. That is the reason why the election of Mohamed to steer the country on the right course to recovery offers real hope. On his own, given the fragile situation and lack of resources and structures, President Mohamed cannot manage. It calls for concerted efforts from regional governments, and specifically the African Union and IGAD, to help Somalia to find its footing.
