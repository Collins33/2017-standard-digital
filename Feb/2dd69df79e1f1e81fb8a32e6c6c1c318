A man has been sentenced to 30 years imprisonment after he was found guilty of defilement. The man is said to have defiled his 15-year-old daughter at his home in Ukunda between July 16 and 17 last year. He was arrested on August 6 and has been in custody since as the court denied him bond on grounds that he could pose a threat to the complainant and her mother. In a previous hearing, Sophy Wanjala, the investigating officer, said the complainant and her mother feared for their lives and that there was a need to keep the accused in custody. The man had denied the charges. It was alleged that before his arrest, the man had been warned by his wife over a similar attack against his daughter.

In his defence, the accused said that he was the sole bread winner of the family and that sentencing him would affect the wellbeing of his dependants. &quot;...therefore I plead to the court to acquit me. I also do not have parents,&quot; he said. Kwale Resident Magistrate Paul Mutai said having considered the evidence given by the witnesses, the prosecution had proved its case. He gave the accused 14 days to appeal.
