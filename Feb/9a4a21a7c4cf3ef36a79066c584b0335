Several Embu MCAs have vowed to stay in office until March 2018, regardless of the outcome of the August 2017 polls, to complete their five-year term. &nbsp;Led by Runyenjes MCA Steve Simba and nominated MCA Rosemary Manunga, they said in the alternative, they should be paid salaries and allowances up to March 2018. &nbsp;They said it was unfair for the electorate to expect them to do a five-year job in less time, adding that they should not be held responsible for underdevelopment if their term is cut short. &nbsp;According to Simba, it is not possible to fast-track pre-election pledges made by MCAs if the county assembly is dissolved by June. - Joseph Muchiri
