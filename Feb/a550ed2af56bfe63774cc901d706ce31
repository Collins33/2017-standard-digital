Deputy President William Ruto has told the Opposition that it has no development record to cling to. The DP told the National Super Alliance (NASA) leaders that they did not stand a chance against Jubilee&#39;s scorecard before Kenyans. Speaking at the African Inland Church (AIC) in Kericho yesterday, Ruto said the Government had implemented major infrastructural, electricity, educational, water among other projects, which he said will convince Kenyans to re-elect President Uhuru Kenyatta. &quot;We are going to the election armed with our scorecard and our performance record, which we are very proud of and we are going to face the electorate knowing very well that our development speaks for itself and we have delivered all of our major pledges,&quot; he said. The DP said the Government would not hesitate to take action against anyone attempting to destabilise peace in the country. &quot;It&#39;s the Government&#39;s responsibility and duty to ensure that the elections are conducted in a peaceful environment. We will not allow chaos to reign. That is why every political aspirant has a responsibility to solicit for votes in a respectful manner free of stone throwing and insults,&quot; he said.
