A group of Kenyans of Asian origin is backing re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August 8 General Election. Mr Farah Mannzoor, who led the team to the Jubilee secretariat offices Monday, said they wanted to start participating in Kenyan politics. &quot;We were born here and our fathers played key roles in building this nation since the fight for independence. That is why we want to be part of what is happening in the country,&quot; he said. Recently, Mannzoor petitioned the Government to have Kenyans of Asian origin recognised as one of the Kenyan communities. A party official who received the group, Ken Marita, said head of secretariat Raphael Tuju was away but was aware of the visit by the group. &quot;As a party, we want to bring all people together. We are not interested in planting seeds of hatred or violence and hooliganism,&quot; said Marita.

Jiza Munir, a leader, said despite their contribution in the development of the country since arriving in Kenya in the 18th Century, their forefathers never asked for recognition. &quot;We regard this country as our home. That is why we are asking the Government to recognise us as one of the communities. This is very important to us,&quot; says Munir. Mannzoor, who has been advocating for the rights of Asian Muslim women since 2010, is eyeing the Westlands Parliamentary seat.
