Nominated Senator Emma Mbura has ditched Jubilee Party for Governor Alfred Mutua&rsquo;s Maendeleo Chap Chap. Announcing the decision from her mother&rsquo;s home in Rabai, Kilifi, the senator said that after wide consultations, she had decided to run for the Rabai parliamentary seat on a Chap Chap ticket in the August election. Dr Mutua received Ms Mbura and two aspirants for Mombasa and Lamu counties on Tuesday. The senator accused some people in Jubilee, whom she did not name, of trying to frustrate her bid. &ldquo;I will defeat their scheme from Maendeleo Chap Chap,&rdquo; she declared.
