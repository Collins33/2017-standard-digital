Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetangula has challenged Jubilee government to provide all aspirants with security as the electioneering mood continue to heat up. Wetangula said that the spate of violence witnessed on Friday where opposition leader Raila Odinga&#39;s rally in Turkana was disrupted by armed youth while two other politicians were shot dead in Baringo has highlighted the failures by the government to beef up security. The Bungoma senator accused government of mismanaging security at a time when political players have started traversing the country to sell their ideas. &quot;The events that took place on Friday where even guns were fired are regrettable and we condemn it in the strongest terms,&quot; said Wetangula. He noted that the government has shown laxity to provide a conducive atmosphere for the opposition to sell their ideas to the people despite all Kenyans having the right to visit any part of the country. &quot;It is saddening to note that some of the political players have now turned to the use of crude tactics that involves guns and stones. That is extremely primitive and is dragging our country back,&quot; he added.
