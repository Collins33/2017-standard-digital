The material from which a tub and sink is made determines how you clean it. Clean your bathtub every week to prevent soap scum buildup and stains. Porcelain bathtubs Most bathtub cleaners are safe for porcelain. For stubborn stains and discoloration, mix a bleaching powder, like ajax or comet, with water to form a thick paste. Scrub the affected area and let it sit for 30 to 45 minutes, rinse and repeat if necessary. For extreme cases, use porcelain sandpaper, a heavy-duty sponge or handheld scrub brush. Acrylic bathtubs Most non-abrasive and non-aerosol bathroom cleaners are safe to use on acrylic. Rinse the chemicals off. To soften mineral deposits with a natural cleaner, use a water and vinegar solution. Do not use abrasive cleaners as they can cause irreversible damage to the acrylic tub liner. Fiberglass bathtubs Clean fiberglass bathtubs with dish-washing liquids, liquid laundry detergents or non-abrasive bathroom cleaners. For a natural cleaner, wet baking soda with water to form a paste and then rub the paste on a sponge or brush to clean. For stubborn stains, let the cleaner sit for an hour. Use acetone nail polish remover to remove tough stains like adhesives, tar and oil-based paints. Use a cotton ball to apply the acetone, and then rinse it off.
