Kangema MP Tairus Ngahu is under investigations over claims he threatened a blogger for criticising him through social media posts. Cyber crime police unit officers are investigating Ngahu after claims he threatened to chop off the manhood of Simon Mwangi if he continues attacking him. &quot;He called me at 2am and after invoking the name of the late Cabinet minister John Michuki, he said he will ensure my private parts are chopped off,&quot; said Mwangi. The blogger claimed he had been receiving threats from people who warned him to stop criticising the CDF team. In a recording posted on social media, a man said to be Ngahu says he had stopped who were going to Mwangi&#39;s home &#39;to deal with him&#39;. In the recording, where a child is crying in the background, the caller tells Mwangi to keep off him.&nbsp; ALSO READ: K24 reporter claims politician threatened him &quot;You are dealing with the wrong number, I have heard your offspring in the background, please note I am in not at your level,&quot; he says. The caller says he does not care about democracy, adding he owns Kangema. &quot;I don&#39;t want your vote. Pray you don&#39;t ever meet me. I am not your age mate and I will show you what will happen if I meet you. I am as dangerous as Michuki,&quot; the caller says. County police boss Naomi Ichami said cyber-crime unit experts are analysing the content to find out if there were threats. And yesterday, Ngahu refused to comment. &quot;That allegation has been overtaken by events and I am not willing to discuss that issue,&quot; Ngahu said.
