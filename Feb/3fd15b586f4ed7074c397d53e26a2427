Former North Imenti MP Silas Muriuki has ditched the Jubilee Party for the Mazingira Greens Party. Mr Muriuki said his decision was informed by suspicion that the Jubilee nominations would not be fair. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have consulted with the electorate and it has been resolved that I move from Jubilee to Mazingira Party, where I am assured of a direct nomination,&rdquo; said Muriuki yesterday when he addressed delegates at Olive Gardens. He said indications were that former Interior PS Mutea Iringo would be handed the Jubilee ticket. The aspirants are seeking to unseat incumbent Rahim Dawood. Muriuki, a former Knut secretary for the former Eastern Province, said he would focus on increasing development projects in the area. &nbsp;
