Kenya has been granted Category One status by the US Federal Aviation Administration. This will pave way for direct flights between Kenya and United States terminating the long search for express connection. The long awaited direct flights from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in Nairobi will allow access of all airports in United America. This comes after the US aviation body carried out a series of assessment audits in&nbsp;Kenya and the Country&nbsp;met all the conditions for establishing direct flights.
