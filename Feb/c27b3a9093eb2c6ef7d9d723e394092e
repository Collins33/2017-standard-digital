US Ambassador to Kenya Robert Godec has said the US administration has no preferred candidate in the August polls. He urged political parties to promote their policies peacefully. &nbsp;Speaking in Gasi, Kwale County, when he toured Mikoko Pamoja and other women&#39;s projects supported by his government, Mr Godec said the US would like to see a peaceful election and democratic outcome in August. He said those who were unsatisfied with the outcome of the election results or the process should seek constitutional bodies like the courts to address their issues. &nbsp;He praised the Mikoko Pamoja project, saying it had opened up job opportunities for local residents.
