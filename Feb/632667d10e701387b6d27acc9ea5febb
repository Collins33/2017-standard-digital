Politicians who have mounted illegal billboards and other campaign material may be fined Sh300,000 by the county government. &nbsp;Billboards, posters and banners urging people to register as voters and bearing the names of aspirants will be brought down. &nbsp;George Ntoiti, the&nbsp;Nairobi sub-county administration chief officer, said no politician should put up banners or billboards because it was not yet election time.
