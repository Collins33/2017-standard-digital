Four lawmakers from Ukambani want Senator Johnstone Muthama dropped from NASA technical team established to pick the Opposition presidential flag bearer. Robert Mbui (Kathiani), Patrick Makau (Mavoko), Susan Musyoka (Machakos County) and Peter Mathuki (East African Legislative Assembly) claimed the Machakos senator was a stumbling block to Kalonzo Musyoka&#39;s bid to secure the Opposition ticket. The legislators spoke in Kathiani constituency in Machakos County after launching a Wiper party membership drive. The MPs also claimed Muthama was responsible for the many defections from the Wiper party by aspirants who have openly accused the senator of fielding &#39;his preferred candidates&#39; to contest on party ticket.
