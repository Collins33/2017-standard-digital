A Rift Valley security team has recommended that Baringo South and North be gazetted as highly unsafe and uninhabitable. Rift Valley Regional Coordinator Wanyama Musiambo on Tuesday said illegal gun possession had led to numerous deaths and loss of property due to rampant cattle rustling. &quot;The Government will not allow some individuals to take advantage of the situation. Security (personnel) have reviewed and made a recommendation (to Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery) for the areas to be declared disturbed,&quot; he said. At the same time, Baringo Senator Gideon Moi called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and end locals&#39; suffering. &quot;The ongoing mayhem in parts of Baringo County as a result of cattle rustling and suspicion among communities which have lived together since time immemorial is saddening and I&#39;m calling on the President himself to address the issue,&quot; he said. Since the Friday killing of Loyamorok MCA Frederick Cheretei and Tiaty parliamentary aspirant Simon Kitamba Pepee at Marigat, tension has been high.

Mr Musiambo said the region will be gazetted as uninhabitable and a security team deployed there to disarm locals and arrest criminal elements. He said the Government will not stand aside and watch as locals are killed or lose property because of &quot;personal interests&quot; of &quot;few individuals&quot;. This came at a time MPs from the county called for the deployment of the military to the region. Story by Mercy Kahenda, Alex Kiprotich and Daniel Psirmoi
