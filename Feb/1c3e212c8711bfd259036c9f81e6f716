Two suspected thugs were Tuesday shot dead by police along Baricho Road in Nairobi in a botched robbery on bank customers. Police said they recovered a Ceska pistol, homemade gun and three bullets from the men who were allegedly planning a robbery on a customer leaving a bank there. The suspects were traveling on a motorbike when police ambushed them at about midday. A third suspect managed to escape on a motorbike during the incident that sent many mechanics operating there scampering for their safety. Head of Special Crimes Prevention Unit Noah Katumo said the men were planning to attack people who withdraw cash from banks when the incident happened. &ldquo;They have been linked to a number of such attacks in which people are attacked and robbed of their cash after making withdrawals from banks,&rdquo; said Katumo. And a 40-year-old night guard was murdered at his place of work in a botched robbery in Spring Valley area, Nairobi.
