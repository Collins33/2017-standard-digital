The Elgeyo Marakwet County&nbsp;Assembly has given the county Executive a three-day ultimatum to submit a Supplementary Budget for drought mitigation.&nbsp; The MCAs have threatened to mobilise residents to storm Governor Alex Tolgos office to oust him if the Supplementary Budget is not brought to the assembly for deliberations. Led by Arror MCA Christopher Chemosong, the MCAs claim the executive has been adamant and lax in getting a solution. However, Finance and Economic Planning Executive Stephen Biwott said they are scrutinising the vote-heads of each department to mobilise the funds.
