Governor Jack Ranguma has moved to resolve persistent wrangles at the county assembly. On Wednesday during the official opening of the fifth assembly, the governor sent a special appeal to the MCAs to embrace unity and work together for the benefit of the people. He noted that the success of devolution could only be realised if the MCAs placed their personal interests aside. &quot;In order to deliver sufficiently on our mandate, the working of this House ought to be harmonious,&quot; said Mr Ranguma. He said the unity between the assembly and the Executive could be the key to solving problems facing the county. The two arms of government have had a frosty relationship, with the MCAs last year accusing the Executive of trying to interfere with operations at the assembly.
