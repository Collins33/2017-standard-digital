&nbsp; Voter apathy hits prisons as inmates fail to register The prisons department has raised concerns over the low number of inmates registering to vote. In Nyahururu GK Prison, Nyandarua County, only 24 inmates had registered by Thursday out of the approximately 400 targeted. Among those who had registered on the second day of the voter registration exercise in the penal institution were 20 men and four women. According to officer in charge of the prison Mathew Kimanzi, most of the inmates were not willing to register because of what he termed &quot;personal reasons&quot;. ALSO READ: I don't have power over voter register, says Nkaissery Mr Kimanzi said that some of them were opposed to the exercise after realising they would only vote for the President during the August elections. He said the inmates would have preferred voting for other seats and that is why they have shunned the exercise. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) officers will be at the correctional facility for a week. More than 800 inmates from Naivasha are expected to be registered as voters by IEBC in the week-long exercise targeting penal institutions. The development came as details emerged that some of the inmates could miss out of the exercise due to lack of identity cards, which they lost before they were jailed.
