A Ugandan who allegedly registered as a voter in Mombasa County has been arrested and charged with forgery and illegal registration. Walukagaa Jaladin, 25, who was arrested in Kisauni, appeared before Mombasa Chief Magistrate Julius Nangea Monday. The arrest comes one week after a Tanzanian, Sentrock Centoephrah Ephrock, was arrested trying to register as a Kenyan. Mr Ephrock, who speaks fluent English and Kiswahili, came to Kenya as a street boy 20 years ago before crossing into Uganda where he stayed as a refugee in a camp. He later found his way to Yemen and attended Funock University, where he studied computer science. Ephrock, who spoke to The Standard from the court&#39;s underground cell, admitted he was Tanzanian but insisted he had spent most of his childhood in Kenya.

Mr Walukagaa, who was charged alongside a man claiming to be his father, Lucas Okungu Odundo from Rarieda East in Konyango sub-location, was released on a bond of Sh500,000 with a surety of similar amount. Walukagaa, alias Salim Jalal Okungu, denied that on November 24, 2016, in Junda Kisauni, Mombasa, he registered as a voter using national identity card number 35430296 after claiming he was born on Mombasa Island.

The accused also denied that he was living in Kenya illegally and was ordered to appear for mention of the case in a fortnight. ALSO READ: Voters Shock for NASA
