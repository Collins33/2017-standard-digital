Former Ethics and Governance permanent secretary John Githongo has refuted claims that his dossier on graft was just based on &#39;gossip&#39;. This follows the watering down of his evidence against former Internal Security Minister Chris Murungaru. Dr Murungaru&#39;s lawyer Kioko Kilukumi had asked Githongo to explain whether his informants gave him any tangible documents other than his recorded conversations in a meeting held on June 29, 2004 at the current State Law office, which houses the Attorney General&#39;s chambers.
