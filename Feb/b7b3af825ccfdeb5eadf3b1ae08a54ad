Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto has yet to decide who to support for the presidency in the August General Election. The governor said he would make his decision as an individual. &quot;I will not advise anyone to vote for anyone at the moment. For me, it is unlikely that I will cast my vote for them (in response to Jubilee Party). The discussion should be how we shall end poverty and how we shall fight off greedy people,&quot; he said. The Chama Cha Mashinani party leader said he would work with like-minded leaders such as Baringo Senator Gideon Moi in speaking the truth. Governor Ruto spoke in Elgeyo Marakwet on Saturday as the National Super Alliance brigade camped in Eldoret to woo voters in Deputy President William Ruto&#39;s backyard. The governor said it was a bad idea for the DP to dissolve the United Republican Party, saying the region lost its bargaining power after joining the Jubilee Party.

The governor waded into the debate over the runaway insecurity in the North Rift, accusing the government of laxity in providing a long-lasting solution. &quot;It is a pity that residents are no longer living in their houses while their cattle is constantly driven away. The government promised us peace and they have to ensure that the region is calm,&quot; he added.
