&nbsp; Meru Senate aspirant Mwiti Kathendu has ditched the Party of National Unity (PNU) for Jubilee. Kathendu, who like Imanyara comes from Senator Kiraitu Murungi&#39;s Imenti region, said he made the decision after realising PNU was hell-bent on handing Mugambi Imanyara the ticket on a silver platter to vie in the August 8 elections. Kathendu was given a rousing applause when he announced his defection during the burial of David M&#39;Muguna, the father of Jubilee Party Meru chapter Secretary General Al Hajj Mwendia, on Friday. Kiraitu received Kathendu to JP and reaffirmed the party&#39;s commitment to holding free and fair nominations. Kathendu said he was still in the race for Senate and will now battle it out for the Jubilee ticket against Kiraitu&#39;s ally Mithika Linturi (Igembe South MP). Kiraitu will not defend his seat, but run for governor. &quot;I want to be in the government, not the opposition. Unlike Mary Mwiti and Jenaro Guantai who have stuck to PNU, I have decided to move out,&quot; Kathendu said.

Kiraitu and MPs Kathuri Murungi (South Imenti), Joseph M&#39;Eruaki (Igembe North) and Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East), who also attended the burial, urged residents to fully back President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election, saying he had initiated mega projects and laid a conducive environment for investment. Kiraitu and his running mate Titus Ntuchiu will face Munya for the governor&#39;s seat.
