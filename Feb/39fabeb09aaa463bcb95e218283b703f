Kenya&rsquo;s team to the World Cross Country championships will be unveiled today after the national cross country trials at Uhuru Gardens. It is expected that the upcoming athletes will attempt to upstage the more established runners considering that only the top two competitors in each category will be picked for the national team. This form of competition is healthy because it means each competitor has a chance if there is no deviation from the qualifying methodology that was adapted by Athletics Kenya (AK). Next month&rsquo;s World Cross Country championships in Kampala will be the first major event in the track and field calendar that a Kenya team will take part in this year. In this respect, we expect our athletes to give a good account of themselves and set a benchmark for the rest of the competitions that are lined up for the season. There will be a lot of preparatory work before the World Cross Country championships on March 26. Therefore, Athletics Kenya should clear all hurdles to ensure the athletes are not distracted during their preparations. ALSO READ: ATHLETICS: Kwale couty to host Coast region race
