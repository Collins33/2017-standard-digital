Two politicians from Uasin Gishu County have welcomed the National Super Alliance (NASA) planned rally tomorrow in Eldoret town but warned against abusive utterances. After signing their coalition agreement, NASA principals Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka, Moses Wetang&#39;ula, and Musalia Mudavadi announced that they would hold their first rally in Deputy President William Ruto&#39;s backyard tomorrow. Turbo MP Elisha Busienei said the opposition leaders, like other Kenyans, have a right to conduct their rallies anywhere in the country. &quot;They can hold as many rallies as they want but they should desist from abusing other leaders and uttering provocative statements that may threaten the peace we are currently enjoying,&quot; he said. The MP said the rally would not have any effect on the popularity of the Jubilee Party in the region. &quot;Uasin Gishu is a Jubilee stronghold. We are the heart of the ruling coalition and purported inroads by the opposition are merely a storm in a cup of tea,&quot; said Busienei.

Mr Mandago, who three years ago opposed a visit by Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) leaders ahead of the 2014 Saba Saba rally, said it would be prudent for NASA leaders to respect area politicians even as they seek votes. &nbsp;
