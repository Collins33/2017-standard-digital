Gatundu south MP Moses Kuria and Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu have been acquitted of&nbsp;incitement to violence charges. &nbsp; The two Members of Parliament were facing hatespeech charges and were arrested and detained alongside four other leaders in Pangani Police Station in June 2016 but later released on a cash bail. Senior principal magistrate Charity Aluoch said that the video presented in court failed to give enough evidence to warrant conviction of the MPs. The other leaders who were &nbsp;arrested with them were Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama, Kitutu Masaba &nbsp;MP Timothy Bosire, Bahati MP Kimani, Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, Kilifi woman representative Aisha Jumwa and Busia woman representative Florence Mutua.
