French President Emmanuel Macron faced the first grassroots revolt from within his own camp on Monday when hundreds of activists asked a court to halt voting on new rules for the political party that helped him win power in May. The challenge came on the heels of a poll showing a slump in the 39-year-old president&#39;s approval rating after a series of politically testing events, including a budget row that prompted the head of the army to quit.

The activists involved in the legal challenge say they number about 1,200, a fraction of the LREM&#39;s total membership of more than 375,000, but they reveal a degree of discontent in the ranks with Macron&#39;s forceful style of leadership.. The group says the disputed statutes would limit decision-making and future internal ballots to the LREM&#39;s upper echelons. &quot;This &#39;lockout&#39; exposes a lack of trust in party members and looks at odds with LREM (party) values,&quot; they said. &quot;The lack of internal democracy is even more distasteful due to the fact that it&#39;s all been done in a rush in the middle of the summer without proper consultation of activists.&quot; A party spokeswoman brushed off the accusations, saying LREM was giving a bigger role to grassroots members in its structures than other French parties and had further increased that power after consulting members earlier this month. A ruling is expected this week on the court challenge after a hearing on Monday. Macron, who swept to power on promises of non-partisan rule and an end to traditional Left-versus-Right politics, has had a tough month, marked by a public row over military spending cuts with top armed forces chief General Pierre de Villiers that led to de Villiers&#39; resignation. An Ifop poll released on Sunday showed Macron&#39;s approval rating falling 10 percentage points to 54 percent. Billed as the biggest drop for a newly elected president since Jacques Chirac in 1995, it echoed a broadly similar result in a recent BVA poll.
