Nzoia Sugar Company has suspended operations due to lack of raw materials to enable sugar milling. Company&#39;s Head of Communication, Gilbert Awino, said they were facing challenges in getting cane to enable sugar milling but they were working on ways of sorting the issue. Mr Awino said they had a challenge in developing cane during the dry season and this had majorly affected their operations. He said the miller had ground to a halt and that they were seeking on avenues to restore the issue quickly adding that cane in their zone was dwindling with the coming of other sugar millers. &quot;We have stopped milling because we do not have cane now. We had a challenge during the dry season and this has even affected us now. We are in the process of working and ensuring the issue is sorted,&quot; he said. Mr Awino said they were looking for funds to enable maintenance of the machines since they were not crushing any cane. ALSO READ: Reprieve for 43 year-old man who was jailed for stealing Sh40 cabbage
