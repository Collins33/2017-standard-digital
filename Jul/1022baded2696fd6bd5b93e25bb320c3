Former Cabinet minister Nicholas&nbsp;Biwott&nbsp;was so discreet he never let his personal aide inside his residence. Accounts of&nbsp;Biwott&rsquo;s&nbsp;secretive and witty lifestyle continued to emerge even as leaders continued to mourn the late former powerful Cabinet minister. Biwott&rsquo;s&nbsp;former aides recalled their boss&rsquo;s secretive lifestyle, with one who served as his personal assistant for six years saying he had never stepped inside his house. Politician Micah Kigen said despite being close to&nbsp;Biwott, he was not allowed to get close to his homestead. Instead, Moi&rsquo;s most powerful minister insisted on picking his assistant at least 2 kilometres away from his residence. &ldquo;Biwott&nbsp;had some uniqueness in his operations. Although I knew his home, I could not get close to his house and would only meet him by the road, about two kilometres away where I would be picked as we headed to the office,&rdquo; said Kigen, who served as his PA between 1988 and 1993. Biwott&rsquo;s&nbsp;peculiar behaviour extended to meal times.

But Kigen remains grateful to&nbsp;Biwott&nbsp;for mentoring him. Their paths crossed one morning in 1981 as Kigen was walking back to school &ndash; Lelboinet Secondary in Keiyo South. A car approached and the driver asked him to get in for a lift to the school. On arriving at the school, the car&rsquo;s driver asked young Kigen if he knew him, to which he said no. &ldquo;He told me he was&nbsp;Biwott&nbsp;and gave me Sh200 pocket money,&rdquo; recounts the politician. Kigen is not alone in his assessment of&nbsp;Biwott&rsquo;s&nbsp;&lsquo;peculiar&rsquo; character. Moses Changwony, who served as an assistant secretary at the Energy ministry during&nbsp;Biwott&rsquo;s&nbsp;tenure, says his boss then would not tell you where he was heading.

NASA leader Musalia Mudavadi, who served as Finance minister in the same Cabinet as&nbsp;Biwott&nbsp;during President Moi&rsquo;s government recalled how he juggled multiple harambees in a day. Nicholas Biwott with Daniel Moi and other KANU members at Parliament buildings Oct 1989 10 harambees &ldquo;One time he invited me to a fundraiser in his Keiyo South constituency and I discovered that he had 10 harambees going on on the same day. What he did was to designate a number of guests but later visit all the ten venues in a helicopter,&rdquo; Mudavadi said. He went on: &ldquo;When he lost his temper, he would tell you a few harsh words or sometimes make sarcastic remarks depending on how you related with him at the time.&rdquo; Journalist Sammy Wambua had an encounter with the witty&nbsp;Biwott. Wambua recalled weeks after the 1997 elections, Steve &ldquo;Magic&rsquo; Mwangi, the newly elected Nairobi Mayor, had organised &lsquo;The Kenya We Want Conference&rsquo; at Safari Park Hotel. It was a grand affair with ambassadors and donor representatives in attendance. ALSO READ: Biwott's wealth remains a mystery During a break to the bathroom, he overheard a conversation between Kivutha Kibwana and&nbsp;Biwott&nbsp;in the urinal. Kibwana was then one of the principals of the National Convention Executive Council, a pressure group that was pushing for a review of the constitution. &ldquo;Professor&nbsp;habari yako&nbsp;(Professor how are you?)&rdquo; the conversation started, to which Kibwana replied &ldquo;Mzuri sana, Bwana&nbsp;Biwott&nbsp;(I am very well, Mr&nbsp;Biwott)&rdquo; Wambua recounted that a very friendly-sounding&nbsp;Biwotttold Kibwana the Government knew he was stubborn but not subversive. He explained why &lsquo;Mzee&rsquo; (President Moi) wanted to make him (Kibwana) an ambassador.&nbsp;Biwottasked Kibwana what he wanted. &ldquo;Katiba tu&nbsp;(just the constitution),&rdquo; replied Kibwana as they left the washroom. Wambua at the time was covering the conference for&nbsp;The Star,&nbsp;a rabidly anti-Kanu biweekly. The next day, the&nbsp;Biwott-Kibwana cloakroom conversation appeared on the paper and everybody thought it was funny. But around noon, somebody told Wambua to pick up the call at Managing Editor Magayu Magayu&rsquo;s office. At the office the man gestured excitedly, whispering, &ldquo;Biwott,&nbsp;Biwott.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sweating in panic, I grabbed the handset and said, &lsquo;Hallo, Sir&rsquo;,&rdquo; Wambua recounted.

When he replied &ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo;&nbsp;Biwott&nbsp; asked: &ldquo;Na hii maneno ulisikia ukiwa wapi&nbsp;(Where did you hear this conversation)?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Nilikuwa kwa choo ile kubwa&nbsp;(I was in the big bathroom),&rdquo; I told him, whereupon he burst into laughter and said &ldquo;bure kabisa&nbsp;(very useless!)&rdquo; and discontinued the call. And Elgeyo Marakwet County&rsquo;s director of Communication Vincent Bartoo recounted an episode when former Cabinet minister Henry Kosgey engaged him in a public spat during a meeting in Iten. The former Tinderet MP had criticised&nbsp;Biwott&nbsp;for his culture of hand-outs. &ldquo;But&nbsp;Biwott&nbsp;hit back, saying he was growing wealthy by the day because he shared what God had given him with ordinary folk,&rdquo; Bartoo recalled. That he led a secretive life is not in doubt. Even in his generosity, he remained secretive in his dealings. &ldquo;When he could not assist you in person, he would use proxies,&rdquo; said Bartoo. He was a man of few words, measured what he said and rarely delegated personal assignment. When he lost his Keiyo South Parliamentary seat in 2007 to a political newcomer Jackson Kiptanui, he personally scripted a brief statement conceding defeat. &ldquo;When he called a press conference, he was the one posing the questions, asking journalists what they thought made him lose his seat. &ldquo;Getting the man on telephone was another headache. He never owned a mobile phone, and could only be reached through his PA,&rdquo; Bartoo recalls. This style of dealing with the media made it easy for him to keep journalists away from his private life. Biwott&nbsp;was a gifted writer. He probably honed this skills when he served as a journalist in his early years. &ldquo;If his biography was to be written, my guess is he would have done it himself.&rdquo; [email&#160;protected]&nbsp; [Sammy Wambua, Luke Anami, Silah Koskei, Titus Too and Fred Kibor]
