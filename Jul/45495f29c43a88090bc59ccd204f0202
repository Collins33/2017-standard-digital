A gubernatorial candidate has pledged to fix garbage and sewerage menace if elected. Jubilee Party candidate Suleiman Shahbal said once eliminated, bacterial diseases would be reduced. He promised to devise a format of collecting garbage in four major centres to give the city a facelift. &quot;I will ensure there are garbage collection points at strategic points,&quot; he said. He claims the county produces 800,000 tonnes of garbage daily, which he argues is enough to put up a 20-megawatts power plant. He said the recycling of the garbage will generate power and promised to change waste collection and dumping dramatically into profitable venture. Shahbal said the outbreak of diseases was as a result of failure to manage sewerage and drainage systems in the county. ALSO READ: Leading Kenya today is no walk in the park, President Uhuru told
