Ex-KTN editor Aaron Obudho Ochieng has formally apologised to former colleague Joy Doreen Biira for stealing her Sh2.8 million Mercedes Benz. &nbsp;Ochieng had appeared before Milimani Senior Principal Magistrate Joyce Gandani and denied two counts of stealing and handling stolen property in January 2017. He was later charged with stealing a motor vehicle belonging to a KTN news anchor Joy Doreen Biira. The magistrate directed Ochieng to deposit cash bail of Sh300, 000 or execute a bond of Sh1 million to secure his freedom. The Mercedes-Benz was stolen from Standard Group&#39;s parking lot along Mombasa Road on December 23. Mr Ochieng was arrested on December 30 in Kisumu and later transferred to Nairobi and detained at Industrial Area police station in connection with the theft of the workmate&rsquo;s car. The charge sheet stated that Ochieng on December 23 at Standard Group Limited offices along Mombasa Road in Nairobi jointly with others not before court stole a motor vehicle KBY 831 K Mercedes Benz class E 220 worth Sh2.8 million, the property of Joy Doreen Biira. &ldquo;On December 30, 2016 at Kondele Shopping Centre in Kisumu City otherwise than the course of stealing you dishonestly retained the said motor vehicle knowing or having reason to believe it to have been stolen, &ldquo; stated the second count of handling stolen property. Joy Doreen Biira and Aaron Ochieng will make agreement and the matter will be mentioned in Court on Friday, July 7.
