At least 370,000 new taxpayers in 10 counties in&nbsp; Western Kenya filed their returns by the June 30 deadline, a 140 per cent rise compared to last year. The rise has been attributed to increased awareness campaigns and hefty fines for non-compliance. KRA&#39;s regional manager Kevin Safari attributed this to &quot;growth in business in the counties and intensified education and stakeholder outreach initiatives&quot;. He said the increased filing was boosted by linking the Government payment system to the online tax register &ndash; iTax, which improved chances of netting tax cheats who make millions of shillings from trading with the state. iTax is a web-based system developed by KRA to simplify revenue collection. The system updates employee and employer ledgers and sends notifications on whether the returns have been filed successfully.
