The national cohesion agency has warned that the voters&#39; register is generating public anxiety ahead of the August 8 elections.&nbsp; The National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) has also admitted that it is anticipating post-poll violence in some parts of the country and called on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to exercise transparency to inspire public confidence. &quot;We are anticipating violence in some areas. We have also made it clear to IEBC that the electoral process must be transparent and credible to inspire public confidence,&quot; said Commissioner Gitile Naituli. Counties identified as violence hot spots include Nairobi, Kisumu, Mombasa, Uasin Gishu, Kiambu, Meru, West Pokot, Kericho, Narok, Nakuru, Kisii, Turkana, Bungoma, Lamu, Kilifi, Homabay, Isiolo, Migori, Baringo and Elgeyo/Marakwet. The commission has picked a team of 235 eminent persons - five from each county - to lead campaigns for peaceful elections. The team is drawn from churches, women groups, renowned personalities from the Government, the private sector and non-governmental organisations, IEBC and youth.&nbsp; ALSO READ: CJ Maraga cautions IEBC on ballot printing &nbsp;
