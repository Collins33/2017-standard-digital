I am busy campaigning, hoping that Kenyans will give me opportunity to continue with the good job that we have already started. If the will of the people is another should be given the opportunity, I will do everything in my power to ensure a smooth transition. Asked about the Chinese take-over of jobs that could be done by Kenyans especially at the Coast, specifically on the drenching at Lamu port, Uhuru said that plans are in place to ensure that jobs that can be done by Kenyans are not given to foreigners. &ldquo;That is why we are investing in the Lamu Port, expanding the Mombasa Port and developing a fishing port in Shimoni in order to create jobs for Kenyans,&quot; said Uhuru in response to Michael Obwocha. Other issues that Kenyans want addressed include the skyrocketing food prices, high cost of living, dwindling health sector, water scarcity in rural areas and land grabbing among others. Uhuru hosted the less than 30 minutes live&nbsp;chat Sunday morning before heading to Garissa on a vote hunting mission.
