Governor Ali Roba has accused a council of elders of trying to impose leaders on the electorate. Speaking at Nyayo Stadium in Nairobi on Sunday during the Jubilee voter mobilisation campaign for the Mandera community in Nairobi, Mr Roba termed the new political vessel, known as Economic Freedom Party (EFP) whose key mandate is to enforce resolution of the council, as a &quot;baseless&quot; unit. Roba said Mandera council of elders had no jurisdiction to impose leaders on the electorate in the region. It emerged the EFP wanted all the leaders who were elected in 2013 replaced after its chairman Isaac Hassan Abey declared that there would be no nominations in Mandera County as the council had hand-picked its candidates for the August 8 poll. &quot;This council has lost touch with the needs of the people in the area. We must tell the people the truth that voting is their democratic right. And they should be not be intimidated by some forces who have lost focus and want to impose leaders on the electorate in the region,&quot; Roba said. Those that had been picked by EFP include former provincial commissioner Hassan Noor Hassan for the governor&#39;s slot, former United Democratic Front chairman Hassan Osman for senator and Amina Gedow as a woman representative.
