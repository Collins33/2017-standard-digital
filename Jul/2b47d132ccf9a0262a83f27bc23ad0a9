Governor Cornel Rasanga has denied claims by his opponents that he stage-managed the recent break-in at the county headquarters. The governor argued that it was pointless to break into the county headquarters to tamper with any evidence, as being alleged by his opponents, yet he could easily get access to the documents if he wanted to get rid of them. Last Monday, burglars broke into the governor&#39;s office and stole documents. Speaking to The Standard yesterday, the governor said he was not &#39;naive&#39; to take part in such activities and questioned how it would benefit him. &quot;The police should investigate this matter and get to the root of it,&quot; he said. Rasanga added that he had nothing to hide and encouraged any interested parties that would like to investigate him to go ahead. Rasanga hit out at Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo for going to the anti-corruption offices to press for investigations into corruption allegations against him (governor).
