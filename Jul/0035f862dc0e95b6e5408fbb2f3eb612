The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) wins appeal on ballot paper printing deal with Al-Ghurair citing time constraints and failure by High Court to consider the election date. Appellate court quashed decision by High Court ordering IEBC to re-retender printing of presidential ballot papers saying the decision did not put in regard the constitutional timelines within which General Election must be held. The five-bench judge ruled that public participation is not a requirement in direct procurement. However, the appellate judges uphold High Court decision &nbsp;that overruled newspaper cuttings as insufficient proof to attest meeting between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Al Ghurair bosses.
