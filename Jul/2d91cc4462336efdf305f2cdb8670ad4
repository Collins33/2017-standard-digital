National Super Alliance (NASA) presidential candidate Raila Odinga has defended his position on the ongoing construction of the Sh34 billion Itare Dam project in Nakuru County. Mr Odinga said his opposition to the construction of the dam was not part of a political strategy to win the Kipsigis vote but was informed by the environmental concerns raised by the Kipsigis Council of Elders. Speaking in Kusumek village in Bureti constituency, Kericho County where he attended the burial of Isaiah Cheluget, a former Nyanza provincial Commissioner, Raila maintained that the dam will have major environmental impact, especially in counties that depend on rivers originating from the Mau forest. He explained to mourners that the dam in Mau Forest - constructed at a cost of 34 billion shillings through a loan funded by the Italian Government, would divert water from the Mau tower to Nakuru town at the expense of counties such as Narok, Bomet, Kericho, Kisii, Nyamira, Kisumu and Homa bay. The former Prime Minister was accompanied by Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony, his Bomet counterpart Isaac Ruto and Suna East MP Junet Mohammed. &nbsp; &nbsp; ALSO READ: Opinion: Is Opposition's fear of secret polling stations tenable?
