Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery has threatened to sue two local Opposition leaders over claims he is planning to eliminate them before elections. He said he will instruct his lawyers to prepare a suit against Governor David Nkedianye and Kajiado Central MP Memusi Kanchori over alleged defamation. The CS was reacting to the report made by the two when they recorded statements at Kajiado police headquarters. They claimed they fear for their lives. &quot;I&#39;m waiting for the full details of the report after which I will take a legal action. Anytime you make an allegation, you must have evidence. By the way, do I look like someone who can eliminate my kinsmen just because of politics?&quot; said Nkaissery. The CS said he has been given the mandate to protect all Kenyans without discrimination and accused the two leaders of seeking sympathy votes by making the allegations. The two accused Nkaissery of allegedly saying Jubilee must win all seats in the county even if it means eliminating those occupying them.
