Two Jubilee Party aspirants have asked the National Super Alliance (NASA) to stop distracting the electoral commission, describing this as a ploy to have the August 8 elections postponed. Ikolomani MP Bernard Shinali and his Mumias East counterpart Benjamin Washiali said the court cases being filed by NASA against the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) were an indication that the Opposition had sensed defeat and was in a panic. Speaking separately during a series of meetings with constituents, the MPs claimed NASA was hell-bent on throwing poll preparations into disarray because they were not ready to face Jubilee. But Maendeleo Development Party leader Amisi Mukanda said IEBC must stick to the law and commit to overseeing free and fair elections.&nbsp;
