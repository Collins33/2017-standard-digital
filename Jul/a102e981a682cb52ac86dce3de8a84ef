Kilifi County Governor Amason Kingi has claimed President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s most important legacy in Coast since 2013 has been to buy off Opposition leaders to join Jubilee Party. Governor Kingi and President Uhuru Kenyatta have exchanged harsh words since Sunday when the President visited Malindi. Tuesday, Uhuru claimed that Kilifi and Mombasa had stagnated because their governors have been hostile to Jubilee. But speaking at Shariani in Kilifi yesterday, Kingi claimed the President was &quot;living in denial&quot; because his frequent visits to Coast have not made Jubilee popular. [Nehemiah Okwemba]&nbsp;
