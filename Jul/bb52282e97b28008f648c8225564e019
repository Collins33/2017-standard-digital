KITALE, KENYA: A game of gambling turned tragic after a man lost his life when he was allegedly killed by a friend after they picked a quarrel. Police in Kitale are now pursuing a suspect who fled after committing the offence. The suspect allegedly hit the deceased, Brian Juma 36, with a blunt object on the head during the incident that occurred on Sunday evening near Kitale industries.

Mwenga has warned residents against risking their money in gambling in a bid to make more money. He said that police have launched a crackdown on people who operate gambling machines in the area.
