&nbsp; President Uhuru Kenyatta with Cabinet Secretary for Education, Science and Technology Dr. Fred Matiang&#39;i at State House, Nairobi. The President issued a statement on the passing on of Cabinet Secretary for Interior and Coordination of National Government Major General (Rtd) Joseph Nkaisserry and announced Dr. Fred Matiang&#39;i as acting CS for Interior and Coordination of National Government. The appointment of Dr Fred Matiang&#39;i&nbsp;as the acting Internal Security Cabinet Secretary has become a campaign tool for pro-Jubilee forces in Gusii. On Sunday, Lawyers Evans Monari and Kennedy Ogeto, both of whom defended President Uhuru Kenyatta during his trial at the International Criminal Court (ICC) together with the Chief of Staff at the office of the Deputy President Kennedy Osinde moved to Gusii to campaign for the Government, where they urged the residents to vote for the Kenyatta-led political formation which they said was favouring the community. The lawyers said the community was enjoying a lot of good will from the Jubilee administration, especially when it comes to appointment to State jobs. They said Dr Matiang&#39;i&#39;s&nbsp; appointment was out of the &quot;good heart&quot; which Kenyatta has towards the community and implored the people to vote for them if they wanted to gain more in terms of development and welfare.&nbsp; &quot;You should ask yourself why the President had to task Matiang&#39;i with the job at the Security department. Our President is very passionate with the people of Gusii and that is why you are witnessing whatever positiveness that is coming our way,&quot; said Mr Ogeto. Osinde took a jibe at the National Super Alliance (NASA) leaders whom he said were allegedly fueling activism against acquisition of land in some parts of the country. He told the Gusii voters to be keen on the land issues which the NASA leaders were perpetuating and warned that members of the community may be victims of such &quot;negative energies.&quot; &quot;For example in Gusii we dont have enough land which can sustain our livelihoods, leave alone staying in because of population pressure. Where do we go if the opposition leaders don&#39;t want land to be sold?&quot; posed Mr Osinde. Monari on his part promised to engage the President in ensuring all the projects which are supposed to be done in the area are completed in time.
