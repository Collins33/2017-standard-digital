Laikipia North Member of Parliament has been arrested in Nanyuki town. Mathew Lempurkel was apprehended by detectives and taken for questioning at Naromoru police station over inciteful remarks. According to his personal assistant, they were on their way to Laikipia County when the MP was arrested in Nanyuki by Laikipia central DCIO. Laikipia County Commander Simon Kipkeu noted that the MP will face charges of incitement and will be arraigned in court on Monday. He said that the MP incited members of the public to invade private ranches in Laikipia while attending a public rally in Moguarak on Thursday. The rally was attended by NASA Presidential Candidate Rail Odinga. &quot;No one is above the law and there is no way the lawmaker can urge residents to invade private ranches in the area. The Constitution is very clear that every member of the public has the right to own land anywhere in the county,&quot; he said. &nbsp; The commander noted the lawmaker urged pastoral communities to graze in any land available for their livestock to survive. &nbsp; &quot;The MP was inciting residents in the area to graze on private ranches even without the acceptance of the owners. This is against the law and we had to take action,&quot; he said. &nbsp; The MP has a case pending in a Nanyuki court for similar remarks made earlier this year. &nbsp;
