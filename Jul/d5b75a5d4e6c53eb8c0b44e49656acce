Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho said that NASA&#39;s common enemy in Mombasa County is the Jubilee party. Joho who was on a campaign tour of Jomvu constituency on Tuesday said that there are also political brokers whom he did not name. He hinted that some aspirants working closely with NASA may secretly be working for Jubilee. &#39;&#39; They are close to us but we know who their masters are and we shall defeat them. You all know what kind of mess our economy is in courtesy of the Jubilee government. Let&rsquo;s kick them out and ensure that Raila Odinga becomes Kenya&#39;s 5th President,&#39;&#39; Joho reiterated. Joho&nbsp;also said that he had told Raila and NASA running mate Kalonzo Musyoka to concentrate on other parts of the country as they seek to ask Kenyans for votes and leave Mombasa to him and his loyal brigade of supporters. &#39;&#39; I asked our Party leader and Presidential candidate to leave Mombasa to me. We have solid support base and are banking on 99 per cent votes for NASA right here,&#39;&#39; he said. Joho said that the Jubilee administration has made it deliberately to influence the allocation of little funds to his county despite its enormous population.

Our allocation is lesser than what Kwale and Kilifi gets from the exchequer,&#39;&#39; Joho alleged.
