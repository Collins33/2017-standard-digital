A Campaigner for Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has been shot dead in Chebukwabi village in Kimilili. According to the police, Robert Barasa was reportedly killed by thugs but they noted that investigations are underway to unearth the motive of killing. A woman was in June killed after supporters to Governor Lusaka and Ford Kenya&#39;s candidate Wycliffe Wangamati engaged in stone throwing as they escorted their leaders to address rallies after being cleared by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). The rowdy groups also destroyed property and vehicles before police came in and fired tear gas and live ammunition. The woman, identified as Kadogo was shot in the chest by an officer as she tried to scamper to safety. Kadogo was reported dead minutes after arriving at the Bungoma Referral Hospital.
