National Super Alliance presidential candidate Raila Odinga and Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto are set to be installed as Kipsigis elders today. Kipsigis Clans Association will conduct the installation at Bomet Green Stadium during a rally to drum up support for NASA ahead of the August polls. Clan Chairman Joseph Kimeto will lead the ceremony which will see Governor Ruto become a community elder. Sources privy to the arrangement says it is set to boost the Governor&rsquo;s chances of defending his seat. Ruto (pictured) is locked in a fierce contest with National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso who is eyeing the seat on a Jubilee ticket. However, the Kalenjin Myoot Council of Elders has opposed the plans. Bishop Paul Leleito has termed it a political gimmick saying the Kalenjin Myoot Council of Elders are the ones solely mandated to install community elders.

We doubt whether the clans association has observed them,&rdquo; he said. He also wondered why the ritual is being performed at a political event and said it will not be recognised. &ldquo;Kapkatet is the only historic grounds where rituals to elevate one to be an elder are conducted,&rdquo; he said, added that &ldquo;those who are going to conduct the installation should not take such activities for granted.&rdquo; He urged residents to give the event a wide-berth saying it does not have the approval of the bona fide elders. &ldquo;For the record, the Kipsigis community should note that we have not okayed the installation of Governor Ruto. It should be consultative,&rdquo; he said.
