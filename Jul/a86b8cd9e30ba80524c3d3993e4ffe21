Governor Joseph Ndathi and Mwea MP Peter Gitau have warned Jubilee Party of major defeat in the August elections. Mr Ndathi and Mr Gitau, who are defending their seats as independent candidates, said the voting pattern was likely to change &quot;since the Jubilee Party nominations were not free and fair&quot;. &quot;The General Election will prove Jubilee wrong for dismissing petitions by those who felt cheated in the nominations,&quot; said Ndathi, who has been silent since the April 24 primaries. He will be facing Jubilee candidate Anne Waiguru as well as Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua among others. [Munene Kamau]&nbsp;
