More than 1,000 female entrepreneurs between the ages of 18-35 years will be trained on new business management skills through social media. The Boost Your Business Initiative, by African Centre for Women Information and Communications Technology (Acwict) and Facebook, targets women in Nairobi, Kisumu, Nakuru, and Mombasa counties. The initiative is a pilot programme aimed at giving young female entrepreneurs an opportunity to gain the most up-to-date tools, insights, and best business practices on the Facebook and Instagram platforms. Acwict Executive Director Constantine Obuya said the drive aims to improve the outreach of women business enterprises both in urban and peri-urban areas. It is estimated that there are about nine million social media users in Kenya alone, with Facebook commanding 6.8 million active users every month. &ldquo;The training will mix Facebook&rsquo;s curriculum with integrated interpersonal interaction activities to enhance understanding of the skills learnt,&rdquo; said Ms Obuya. It is expected that all beneficiaries of the initiative will have both Facebook and Instagram business pages to increase visibility.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Kenya shamed in global gender list
