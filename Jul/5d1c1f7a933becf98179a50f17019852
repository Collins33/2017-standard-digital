Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader Musalia Mudavadi will today embark on a one-week tour of Western region to drum up support for the party&#39;s candidates. The tour aims to enhance the party&#39;s chances of bagging as many elective positions as possible in the August 8 polls. Godfrey Osotsi, ANC&#39;s secretary general, said Mr Mudavadi would also drum up support for National Super Alliance (NASA) presidential candidate Raila Odinga. Mudavadi is expected to begin his tour in Kakamega before going to his Vihiga home turf. The tour comes in the wake of rivalry pitting NASA affiliate parties (ANC, Orange Democratic Movement and Ford Kenya) against each other and threatening to scuttle the alliance in areas considered Opposition strongholds including Western, Nyanza and Coast regions. Mr Osotsi has appealed to Raila to rein in leaders disparaging other political players in NASA before things get out of hand, saying ODM&#39;s push for six-piece voting for its party candidates was threatening the alliance&#39;s unity in some areas.
