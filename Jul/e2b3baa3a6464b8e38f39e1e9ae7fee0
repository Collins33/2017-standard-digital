A criminal land case in which Nairobi Senator Mike Mbuvi Sonko is listed as a prosecution witness has failed to take off. A witness slated to testify in the case Ruwa Mwaruwa Kurera is accused of fraudulently obtaining Sh16 million from a German, Morgenstern Joachim, by pretending he could sell land in Shanzu, Mombasa County, that he did not own. The prosecution informed the court that Kennedy Mokaya, who was bonded to testify, said he could not make it to court. The German&#39;s lawyer, Lucy Momanyi, urged the court to urgently resolve the matter, saying the case had stalled since 2012. She argued that the court had powers to summon a witness who failed to appear. &quot;My client lost more than Sh20 million in this matter and the prosecution seems to be very reluctant to deal with it,&quot; said Ms Momanyi. But in a strange twist, the German&#39;s lawyer wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) requesting that the senator should be investigated, saying he was involved in the alleged transaction.

Momanyi insisted her client recognised Sonko from the swearing-in ceremony of MPs in Parliament after he was elected as the MP for Makadara in late 2009. She claimed Sonko was one of the beneficiaries of the money obtained from the fraud. But in a police statement dated October 16, 2010, Sonko denied the claims, saying he knew nothing about the transaction. He also denied using an identity card bearing the name Mike Munga Kurera and his photograph. &quot;I was informed that the said identity card had been used by somebody who fraudulently assisted one Ruwa Mwaruwa Kurera to obtain Sh16 million from a German national by pretending he had a beach plot in Shanzu for sale,&quot; said Sonko in the statement.&nbsp; &nbsp; ALSO READ: MRC now seeks peaceful elections in August
