National Vision Party (NVP) Senate aspirant Albert Kiming&#39;in, popularly known as Ole Kitii, has dismissed reports that he has been paid Sh10 million by Jubilee Party to shelve his bid. The 25-year-old master&#39;s graduate in economics from Kenyatta University accused his Jubilee opponent of maligning his name. &quot;These are baseless rumours and I want to tell the people of Narok that I will never betray the trust they have bestowed on me. I am still fully in the race,&quot; Mr Kiming&#39;in told The Standard. Kiming&#39;in, who has marshalled massive support from his Kipsigis community and youths of the Ormeshuki age set across the county, will be facing Jubilee&#39;s Nkoidila Lankas and Orange Democratic Movement party&#39;s Ledama ole Kina in the August polls. He said his opponents were jittery about his growing popularity as an agent of change. Reached for comment, Mr Lankas denied his opponent&#39;s claims and accused him of trying to seek attention. He denied that there was an attempt to pay his rival to step down from the race. &quot;I am ready to face my opponents at the ballot. I cannot bribe anyone to step down as I have the will of the people. Those claiming so are desperate for attention,&quot; said Lankas.
