A former head of the civil service wants a former minister removed from the charge sheet of those accused of involvement in the multi-billion shilling Anglo-Leasing scandal. Francis Muthaura&nbsp;testified that former Finance minister David Mwiraria did not benefit from the Anglo Leasing proceeds and should not have been dragged to court to face trial. &quot;My opinion is that Mwiraria did nothing wrong when he approved the contracts for Anglo Leasing. I believe he was innocent and should not have been charged,&quot; said Muthaura. He added that when Mwiraria and his former Cabinet colleagues, Chris Murungaru and Kiraitu Murungi, were suspended, it was not because they had participated in the scandal but to pave the way for investigations. Mwiraria, former permanent secretaries Dave Mwangi and Joseph Magari, a former head of debt management, David Onyonka, and businessmen Deepak Kamani, Rashmi Kamani, and Chamanlal Kamani were charged with conspiracy to defraud the Government. Magistrate Felix Kombo, however, declined an application to have Mwiraria&#39;s name removed from the charges, ruling that he had pleaded to them and that despite his death, there would be no prejudice if his name remains on the charge sheet. &quot;It is true his trial was postponed indefinitely when he was ailing and now that he is gone, there is no justification to compel the DPP to amend the charges to remove his name,&quot; ruled Kombo. Muthaura said he became aware of the scandal when then President Mwai Kibaki asked him to find out what had happened after reports merged that public funds had been lost through a project to modernise police equipment. &quot;Our concern was whether the right government procedures had been followed,&quot; said Muthaura.
