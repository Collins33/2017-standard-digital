A scrap metal dealer has won a 29-seater Isuzu matatu worth Sh4.6 million in the just-concluded Shikilia Nganya Na Pilsner consumer promotion. Gabriel Waithaka Kuria, 55, who is based in Gikomba, drove away with the brand new vehicle in the three-month East African Breweries promotion that rewarded Pilsner consumers across the country with airtime, smartphones, home theatres, motorbikes and assorted merchandise. The matatu was handed over by Kenya Breweries Head of Beer Janice Kemoli at a function held at K1 Bar and Restaurant in Parklands. &ldquo;This campaign has captured the hearts and minds of consumers in Kenya with many proud to &lsquo;Shikilia Uzito&rsquo; with Pilsner. We will continue to engage with our consumers and they should expect exciting campaigns in future,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
