Samburu County nurses have threatened not to support the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta if their CBA is not considered and their demands looked into. They urged the President to stop his campaigns and concentrate on ending the strike. The health workers took to Maralal streets on Saturday morning saying the Government should treat the strike as an emergency. The Organising Secretary James Longonjine said that the nurses&rsquo; strike is not a priority to the leaders. &quot;What is priority to them is their campaigns and we are telling them come August 8th if they are not going to solve this we are going to show you the way,&quot; said Lengonjine. The nurses urged the Head of State to push for the signing of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
