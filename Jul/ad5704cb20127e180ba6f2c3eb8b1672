Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has accused President Uhuru Kenyatta and his administration of denying Coast residents a chance to own land. Kingi said the Jubilee administration had failed to tackle the land problem in its four and half years in power, despite promising Coast residents that they would give out more than 60,000 title deeds yearly. He said despite the county government having surveyed and adjudicated more than 40,000 parcels of land, not a single title deed had been delivered to Kilifi residents. &ldquo;As a county we have moved with speed to survey land and forward names of beneficiaries who are supposed to receive title deeds. But what is alarming is three years since we sent the names, no one has received a title deed,&rdquo; said Kingi. Speaking during a public meeting with Chonyi leaders in Mwarakaya, Junju and Chasimba wards in Kilifi South Sub-county, Kingi said Jubilee has failed to investigate the region&rsquo;s historical land injustices that have made residents live as squatters on their land. The governor said despite the government having the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) report, none of the recommendations has been implemented because the people implicated are either in government or have direct connection to President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s administration.
