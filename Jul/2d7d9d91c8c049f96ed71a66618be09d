Barely a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto took their Jubilee campaigns to Machakos County, the Opposition returned to the region and asked local residents to ignore Jubilee promises. National Super Alliance presidential running mate Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula and Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi dismissed claims by the Jubilee government that it had initiated more development projects in Ukambani than any other regime in Kenya&#39;s history. The three NASA co-principals toured Masinga, Yatta and Mwala constituencies where they addressed a series of political rallies accompanied by dozens of local politicians allied to the Opposition. The Opposition leaders claimed some projects Uhuru and Ruto had launched in the region were conceived during the previous regime headed by former President Mwai Kibaki, former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and Kalonzo, who was the vice president. &quot;Uhuru and Ruto said they would bring laptops to Standard One pupils and they failed. It was Raila and I who pushed the plan to rehabilitate Yatta canal and they claim the project was theirs. They have simply run out of ideas,&quot; said Kalonzo. Mudavadi said the national foreign debt had increased to Sh4 trillion under Jubilee. ALSO READ: NASA and Jubilee battle in North Mugirango as arch-rivals meet again
