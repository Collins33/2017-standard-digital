Nairobi governorship candidate Peter Kenneth tore into his opponents&#39; credentials and urged the city residents to vote for him. He said governor Evans Kidero would only be remembered for cholera while Mike Sonko could not be trusted with the leadership of the county. Kenneth was in Ngando Ward in Dagoretti South Constituency Wednesday where he also shared his vision. He took a swipe at his Jubilee opponent Mike Sonko, terming the senator a let-down and only waiting for his party leader to swing him around since he had no agenda for the Dagoretti people. He said Sonko could not be trusted as he was a constant failure, based on his&nbsp; previous posts. &quot;Sonko has so many names, I am not sure what his real name is, but I know of one which he is referred to mostly. You cannot trust someone with no real name,&quot; said Kenneth. He took note of the water problem the area, promising to provide clean running tap water soon after taking over. He also urged the residents not to drink the water being supplied by tankers, saying it would expose them to&nbsp; cholera.
