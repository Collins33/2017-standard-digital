&nbsp; South African Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba laid out an ambitious 14-point programme Thursday to wrench the economy out of recession. It includes the sale of non-core assets and partial privatisation of state-owned firms. The plan to stimulate growth in the continent&rsquo;s most industrialised economy appears to represent an ideological shift in the African National Congress (ANC), whose political alliance with the unions has tended to make privatisation a dirty word. Action plan A team commissioned by President Jacob Zuma to review state firms last year recommended that some be sold. Now the government has set a date - March 2018 - to roll out a &#39;private sector participation framework&#39;.

The government would also reduce the number of debt guarantees to the firms, especially those extended for operational purposes, he said. Analysts said Gigaba&rsquo;s plan could face opposition. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure how far he is going to be able to get with this because I think ideologically there&rsquo;s a lot of opposition,&rdquo; NKC African Economics analyst Gary van Staden said. &ldquo;The last time I heard the ANC even talk about privatisation or even talk about sale of state-owned assets on any kind of level is when Thabo Mbeki was president. It&rsquo;s been a long time.&rdquo; South Africa&rsquo;s economy entered recession for the first time since 2009 and is struggling with high unemployment and credit ratings downgrades. Many of its 300-odd state-owned companies are a drain on the government.&nbsp;
