The frozen bodies of a Swiss couple who went missing 75 years ago in the Alps have been found on a shrinking glacier, Swiss media said on Tuesday. Marcelin and Francine Dumoulin, the parents of seven children, had gone to milk their cows in a meadow above Chandolin in the Valais canton on August 15, 1942. &quot;We spent our whole lives looking for them, without stopping. We thought that we could give them the funeral they deserved one day,&quot; their youngest daughter Marceline Udry-Dumoulin told the Lausanne daily Le Matin. &quot;I can say that after 75 years of waiting this news gives me a deep sense of calm,&quot; added the 79-year-old. In an overnight statement, Valais cantonal police said that two bodies bearing identity papers had been discovered last week by a worker on Tsanfleuron glacier near a ski lift above Les Diablerets resort at an altitude of 2,615 metres (8,600 feet). DNA testing would be carried out to confirm the identities of the couple. &quot;The bodies were lying near each other. It was a man and a woman wearing clothing dating from the period of World War Two,&quot; Bernhard Tschannen, director of Glacier 3000, told the paper. &quot;They were perfectly preserved in the glacier and their belongings were intact.&quot; &quot;We think they may have fallen into a crevasse where they stayed for decades. As the glacier receded, it gave up their bodies,&quot; he told the daily Tribune de Geneve. Marcelin Dumoulin, 40, was a shoemaker, while Francine, 37, was a teacher. They left five sons and two daughters. &quot;It was the first time my mother went with him on such an excursion. She was always pregnant and couldn&#39;t climb in the difficult conditions of a glacier,&quot; Udry-Dumoulin said. &quot;After a while, we children were separated and placed in families. I was lucky to stay with my aunt,&quot; she said. &quot;We all lived in the region but became strangers.&quot; &quot;For the funeral, I won&#39;t wear black. I think that white would be more appropriate. It represents hope, which I never lost.&quot;
