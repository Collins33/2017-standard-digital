Deputy President William Ruto had a rough time addressing residents of Chemolingot and Tiaty in Baringo County at the weekend. Mr Ruto, who was on a tour of the region with a section of Jubilee aspirants, met resistance when he tried to introduce them to the crowd. The crowd heckled the DP as he attempted to introduce the governor and senatorial seat aspirants. The residents could be heard denouncing governorship aspirant Stanley Kiptis and his senatorial counterpart, Simon Chelugui. Ruto tried to seek support for Mr Chelugui and Mr Kiptis, but the residents heckled him as others mentioned the Opposition. This was the second time Ruto and his team have faced hostility from the residents of Kabartonjo. [Julius Chepkwony]&nbsp; ALSO READ: Most voters &lsquo;not swayed by tribe and party manifestos&rsquo;
