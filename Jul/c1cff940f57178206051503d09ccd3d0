A former head of civil service has sued his son and a bank for selling his 93-acre&nbsp;family farm without his knowledge. William Wamalwa, 84, a former chancellor of Maseno University, and his wife Rose Wamalwa, 80, have accused their last-born son Edgar Kwoma Wamalwa of irregularly seeking to dispossess them of the family property. &quot;Our son accessed our records without our permission and knowledge and took the title deed to secure a Sh2 million loan from Ecobank Kenya Ltd. They even went ahead to enter a consent for auctioneers to sell the land to recover the loan facility without our knowledge,&quot; said Mr Wamalwa. Wamalwa, a cousin to former Vice President Kijana Wamalwa and Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, described himself as a public figure who served in the first Cabinet after independence until 1974 before moving to United Nations and later to Maseno University as the chancellor. In an application filed before the commercial court, the couple wants to stop their son, Ecobank Ltd and Consumasters East Africa Ltd from selling or auctioning the land in Kitale, and that a transfer of the title deed as security for the loan advanced to their son be revoked. They also want an order stopping any sub-division of the land or any notification for sale to the public.

Their son told them he had sold the land at a higher price and, after deducting the loan arrears, opened an account for the parents to keep the balance. [email&#160;protected]
