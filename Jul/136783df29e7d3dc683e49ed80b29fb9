Given the studious silence from both tiers of Government, someone new to Kenya would never guess there is a crisis in the medical sector where nurses are on strike. Kenyan nurses downed their tools on June 5, 2017 to protest against failure by the Government to honour a 2013 Comprehensive Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The nurses&rsquo; strike began at the wrong time, when those who should have ideally addressed their grievances had their energies directed in getting re-elected to office on August 8. All attention is riveted on political campaigns to the extent that street demonstrations by nurses across the country hardly register. Even though the CBA was signed by nurses and the national government, there have been attempts by the national government to pass off the strike as the governors&#39; headache. Yet the governors&rsquo; response is simple; give us the allocations to effect the pay hike. Devolving medical services has not achieved the desired goal. This is made worse by buck-passing between county and national governments; none willing to take responsibility whenever there is unrest. A doctors&rsquo; strike that began in December 2016 and lasted two months showed the little regard the Government has for workers, especially where there is a prior commitment to bettering pay. A situation where hospitals are without nurses for close to two months qualifies for a national emergency deserving attention at the highest levels of governance, but sadly, that is not the case. This silence should not continue; Kenyans demand a solution.
