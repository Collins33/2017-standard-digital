A sub-chief from Mwakirunge village has been sued for child upkeep. The administrator&#39;s wife moved to court seeking a Sh37,800 monthly maintenance from him after he left her for another woman. She claims the two were married in Mtongwe, Mombasa County, on June 29, 2013 and have two children, one aged two years and another aged three months. The woman wants the court to compel the sub-chief to pay a subsistence fee of Sh18,000 every month, and all medical expenses incurred. She also wants him to provide Sh15,000 for clothing each year for both children, and Sh4,800 to buy diapers for both children every month. The woman claims the children have been suffering since their father suddenly stopped providing for them.
