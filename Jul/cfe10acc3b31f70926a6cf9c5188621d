A fresh storm is brewing between the Government and giant internet firm Google over the content published on the latter&#39;s YouTube channel. This comes in the wake of heightened campaign activities that have seen aspirants take to social media to popularise their agenda in a bid to win votes. The Government has, however, raised concern over the proliferation of hate speech being published on social media channels including Facebook, YouTube and WhatsApp, with authorities mulling ways to stem the vitriol. &quot;We have seen a lot of activity online during the campaign season and I can tell you that almost everyday, there is someone calling me to take down some piece of inciting content,&quot; explains Joe Mucheru, Information, Communication and Technology Cabinet Secretary.

He called on Google to take down the video. The video, which had more than 185,600 views on Facebook by the time of going to press, speculates on the cause of the sudden death of&nbsp; Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery. &quot;Did Nkaissery really die or did they force him to die?&quot; Mutahi Ngunyi asks rhetorically in the nine-minute video before adding; &quot;in my view, Nkaiserry was assassinated.&quot; However, a postmortem conducted on Monday revealed Nkaissery died of a heart attack.
