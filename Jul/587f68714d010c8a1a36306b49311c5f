Striking nurses have turned their anger on political aspirants, accusing them of ignoring their plight. The local Kenya National Union of Nurses secretary, Sylvester Nganda, said politicians are only worried about how they will get to power and do not care about the suffering nurses and patients. &quot;We are keenly watching them, especially the governorship aspirants. None of their manifestos is talking about us. &nbsp;The August elections are fast approaching and we will shock them,&quot; said Mr Nganda. Services in public hospitals remain paralysed due to the ongoing nurses&#39; strike. Nurses are demanding that a collective bargaining agreement they allegedly signed with the Government be implemented before they resume work.
