Garissa Governor Nathif Jama has dismissed claims that he has pocketed Sh5.2 billion from his government&#39;s coffers. Speaking on his behalf, lawyer Ahmednassir Abdullahi said there was no iota of truth in the allegations by Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission that Jamah had siphoned the money and stashed it in his bank accounts. &quot;EACC CEO Halakhe Waqo is being used by Nathif&#39;s opponents. The documents are a forgery. Halakhe will be personally responsible as no investigations have been done in the bank.&quot; He added: &quot;This shows how low the commission can go to do a job for people who pay them.&quot; Yesterday, a section of the media reported that Nathif made huge deposits in his accounts in First Community Bank.
