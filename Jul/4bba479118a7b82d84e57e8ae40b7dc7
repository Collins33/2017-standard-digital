Some tourism stakeholders have urged the Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) to promote new products at the Coast such as&nbsp;underwater archaeology. Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers (Kahc) Coast branch Executive Officer Sam Ikwaye said&nbsp;archaeology, which is still at its infancy, will attract many tourists if well marketed. &quot;We will have an advantage over our competitors if we tap into some of these new markets. This is a way of diversifying our products will will offer tourists more experiences and which will translate into enhanced earnings for for players and the country at large,&quot;&nbsp;Ikwaye said. Underwater archaeology is a new and unique tourist attraction at the Kenyan Coast. It is a discipline, within archaeology as a whole, that specifically studies human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers through the study of associated physical remains, be they vessels, shore side facilities, port-related structures, cargoes, human remains and submerged landscapes. In January, the National Museums of Kenya (NMK), in partnership with the Italian Cultural Institute, held an underwater exhibition along the coastal line in Malindi. The exhibition was compiled by local underwater archaeologist and Malindi Museum Curator Ciza Bita and showcased the rich archaeological history in the Kenyan waters.
