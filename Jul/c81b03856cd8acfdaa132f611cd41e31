Religious leaders have appealed to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to conduct credible elections. Mombasa Catholic Archbishop Martin Kivuva and Anglican Church of Kenya Bishop Julius Kalusaid Kenyans were not ready to be plunged into chaos, as was the case in 2007-2008, which saw thousands displaced. &quot;We urge IEBC to conduct honest and reliable elections on August 8 because Kenyans don&#39;t want war,&quot; said Kivuva on Snday. The religious leaders were accompanied by Garissa Catholic Bishop Joseph Alexandro.
