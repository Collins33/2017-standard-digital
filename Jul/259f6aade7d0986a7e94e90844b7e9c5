Siaya Senator James Orengo has told Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo to stop using NASA Presidential Candidate Raila Odinga&#39;s name during his campaigns. Mr Orengo said Gumbo (independent), who is seeking to unseat Governor Cornelius Rasanga, should stop invoking Raila&#39;s name to woo voters because he defected from the Orange Democratic Party. Speaking in Gumbo&#39;s backyards Uyoma, Asembo and Ndori shopping centres, Orengo accused Gumbo of betraying Raila and the entire Luo community.
