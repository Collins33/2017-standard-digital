NZOIA, KENYA: Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa and Governor Patrick Khaemba have clashed over corruption claims and controversial purchase of a private property worth Sh 185 million by the County Government. A call by the Cabinet Secretary that Governor Khaemba be jailed over the alleged misuse of Sh 1 billion on the controversial procurement of a private property that the county intends to make a referral hospital has elicited anger from the Governor. Last Friday, while distributing 900 bags of rice to local Muslims at Pangani mosque in Kitale donated by President Uhuru Kenyatta&nbsp;the CS accused the Governor of wasting public money to purchase the property whose construction was stopped by the High Court following a petition by two residents. &quot;Governor Khaemba should not be seeking a second term but instead he should be serving jail term for misusing public funds,&quot; said Wamalwa urging the electorate to reject leaders involved in looting of public coffers. He blamed rampant corruption in the county government for the slow pace of development and vowed to ensure those involved in the vice take responsibility. But Khaemba on Tuesday hit back at the CS accusing him of inciting the residents against him and his administration on baseless grounds. &quot;I have not stolen any money as claimed by Eugene. I&#39;m not his wife and he should stop following me,&quot; Khaemba furiously reacted to calls by Wamalwa for his prosecution. The County Government purchased the property from a Kitale tycoon at the cost of Sh 185 million and has since then injected over Sh 800 million in its completion. The transaction triggered public outcry that the cost was exaggerated before two residents moved to court to contest the procurement deal citing lack of public participation.
