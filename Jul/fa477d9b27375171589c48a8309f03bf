Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa has dismissed accusations by NASA principals Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula that he is a traitor to the Western community. Speaking when he donated a school bus to Kijana Wamalwa Memorial Secondary School in Milimani, the CS said it was wrong for the two leaders to brand him a traitor because he is serving in the Cabinet yet the same people served in other governments. &ldquo;Mudavadi and Wetang&rsquo;ula served in the regimes of retired presidents Moi and Kibaki and I wonder why they are against me serving in president Uhuru&rsquo;s government,&rdquo; said Wamalwa. He clarified that he was not opposed to the quest for presidency by the Luhya. &ldquo;Mudavadi and Wetangula served in previous regimes and I wonder why they are against me serving in Jubilee,&rdquo; he said.
