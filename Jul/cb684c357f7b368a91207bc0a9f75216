A show of might by the police service, no matter how innocent, carries with it the potential of sending all the wrong messages to the public. The situation is worse when such show is put on display only days to the country&rsquo;s General Election in less than three weeks. Kenya has had cases of post-election violence in the past. In 2007, our security services were caught napping when violence broke out following a disputed outcome. The result was the displacement of over 500,000 Kenyans and the deaths of 1,300. Such is what any sensible Government would do everything in its power to stop from happening again. Understandably, the Government has every right to ensure nothing disrupts the prevailing peace in the country. As preparations for the August elections get into high gear, it is commendable that the police plan enforce the law with great zeal. The protection of life and property is cardinal, but they must not in their enthusiasm to show their muscle power, break the law.Whereas the protection of life and property is cardinal, the officers must not get carried away as they discharge their duties. A police force keen to cultivate good working relations with the public-beyond the elections-must conduct themselves with great restraint while maintaining the law and protecting life and property. Should the police break the law, eternal condemnation will follow Inspector General of the Police Service Joseph Boinnet and his boys in blue.
