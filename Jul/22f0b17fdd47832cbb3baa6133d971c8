Several people were injured when two rival groups clashed in Eldoret town, in Uasin Gishu County. The Friday evening incident occurred as gubernatorial aspirant Zedekiah Kiprop alias Buzeki&rsquo;s convoy made its way into the town near the Silverline Hotel. Police lobbed teargas canisters to disperse the rowdy crowds as Buzeki, an independent candidate battling Jubilee&rsquo;s Governor Jackson Mandago, sped away. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission warned of dire consequences if the rivals do not conduct peaceful campaigns. &ldquo;An appropriate action will be taken against the perpetrators. We are mandated by law to suspend campaigns if anyone fails to adhere to the electoral code of conduct,&rdquo; said Uasin Gishu Returning Officer Winston Nyonje. &ldquo;The police have been instructed to take action against those involved in political violence in Eldoret ahead of the elections. The incident will be investigated and those involved taken to court,&rdquo; added Uasin Gishu County Commissioner Abdi Hassan.
