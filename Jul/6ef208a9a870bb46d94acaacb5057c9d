Two Indian families are locked in a fight over 0.1 acres with a high-rise building in Narok town that belonged to their grandfathers. Zubeda Bhachu has sued the Narok County Lands Register for refusing to transfer the land to her family even after the High Court found that the land did not belong to the family of Hava Isak Suleiman, who allegedly took advantage of her old age to irregularly transfer the land. &quot;Hava Isak fraudulently registered herself as the proprietor of the land but despite the High Court cancelling her title, the land registrar has declined to effect the changes. I am old and sickly but I cannot put my house in order because my title was irregularly acquired,&quot; said Ms Bhachu. Through lawyer Masore Nyang&#39;au, Bhachu claimed her grandfather settled in Narok before 1905 and was given the land. They turned it into a residential building but later enhanced it to a commercial high-rise building. Bhachu said she inherited the property when her father and grandfather died in 1990, and she continued developing it. &quot;Ms Bachu lived peacefully on the premises with her sister until 1997, when Hava Isak and her husband invaded the place, claiming they were the registered owners of the premise having also inherited it from their fathers,&quot; said Mr Nyanga&#39;u.
