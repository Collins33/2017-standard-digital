Police are blaming the Power of Mercy Committee, which recommends pardoning of prisoners, for the rise in petty theft and burglary. &quot;We have rearrested some of those who were pardoned by the President on June 1,&quot; said Nyeri OCPD Muinde Kioko on Tuesday. In the past one month, burglary and petty theft have become rampant with cases reported weekly.
