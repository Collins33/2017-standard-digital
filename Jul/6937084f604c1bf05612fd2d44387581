Nyandarua Governor Daniel Waithaka has for the second time in two months changed his running mate creating confusion in the agriculture rich area. &nbsp; Waithaka,&nbsp;an independent candidate, has dropped Gikonyo Gathimba as his running mate and opted for the elder brother Mwangi Gathimba. &nbsp; Gikonyo dropped out of the race for the Kinangop constituency to support Waithaka while Mwangi lost in the Jubilee primaries for the governor seat. &nbsp; Following the move, supporters of Gikonyo have lashed out at the governor, vowing to support the Jubilee candidate Francis Kimemia, in the elections. &nbsp; They have threatened to hold a demonstration in Kinangop over the weekend adding that the governor was&nbsp;splitting a family and segregating hundreds of his voters. &nbsp; Addressing the press, Gikonyo told of his shock when the governor decided to ditch him and go for his brother without informing him. &nbsp; &quot;I shelved my ambitions for the Kinangop seat, to support Waithaka and be his deputy in the primaries and the general elections, but he has decided to stab me in the back,&quot; he said. &nbsp; Gikonyo added that he has since decided to mobilise his supporters and back Kimemia, a former secretary to the cabinet, for the governor&#39;s post. &nbsp; &quot;After consulting my supporters we have agreed to back the Jubilee candidate Francis Kimemia for the governor&#39;s seat,&quot; he said. &nbsp; Efforts to get comments from the governor were fruitless as he was unavailable on his mobile phone, with close confidants saying he was busy with campaigns. &nbsp; This came as the current deputy governor Waithaka Mwangi threw his weight behind another independent candidate Moses Ndirangu alias &#39;&#39;Badilisha&#39;&#39; for the position of governor.
