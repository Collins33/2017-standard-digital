Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet says police are working to establish if there are people masquerading as police officers trailing National Super Alliance (NASA) presidential candidate Raila Odinga. Mr Boinnet said Raila enjoyed State protection as required by the law and denied knowledge of police trailing him as he campaigned. &quot;If there are individuals purporting to be police officers and trailing him in the campaigns, I don&#39;t know, but we will investigate,&quot; said Boinnet. The IG was responding to concerns by NASA leaders that strangers believed to be police officers were trailing them as they campaigned. The NASA brigade petitioned Boinnet to guarantee the security of Raila and his co-principals as the country prepares for the August 8 elections. Boinnet also said police officers were apolitical and would provide a secure environment for Kenyans to vote.

He made the remarks amid concerns there would be challenges in many parts of the country, especially in northern Kenya and Lamu, where Al-Shabaab militants have been staging attacks.
