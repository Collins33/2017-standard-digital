East African Portland Cement Company (EAPCC) has cut the price of its flagship Blue Triangle product by 10 per cent on improved efficiency. A bag will now cost Sh540 after the company slashed its ex-factory price, saying the windfall to customers follows cost savings as a result of improved processes. The prices may, however, vary per distributor. The listed manufacturer, which is currently implementing a strategic turnaround plan, says it has also bolstered its financial performance and ensured consistent product availability. &ldquo;Over the past 10 months, we have been re-engineering our processes from production to distribution, sales and marketing besides securing availability of raw materials and working on cost management,&rdquo; said EAPCC Managing Director Simon Peter Ole Nkeri. Cement prices are at a 10-year low following cheap imports from China, India and Pakistan and uptick in local production.
