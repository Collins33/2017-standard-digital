Bomet Governor and Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) party leader Isaac Ruto has termed as uncalled for and uncivil attempts to disrupt rallies addressed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA Presidential candidate Raila Odinga recently. &nbsp; &quot;Those who tried to heckle NASA leaders in Kabarnet town while claiming the area was a Jubilee zone should know that their leaders will visit NASA and CCM strongholds to campaign and we can choose to kick them out. But that is not how we want to run our campaigns. We want all leaders to be free to conduct their campaigns across the country without fear of attack,&quot; Ruto said. &nbsp; He called on supporters of various political parties to exercise a lot of restrain and tolerance during the campaign period and allow leaders to propagate their ideals in a democratic manner and adhere to election rules. &nbsp; &quot;I am inviting Presidential candidates Cyrus Jirongo, Abduba Dida, Eukuru Aukot and Joseph Nyaga to campaign in Rift Valley region and they should be accorded the respect they deserve. Those who do not subscribe to their school of thought should keep off the rallies instead of attending with a view to disrupting them,&quot; Ruto noted. &nbsp; NASA leaders Musalia Mudavadi, Isaac Ruto and Raila Odinga were booed in Kabarnet, Baringo County a few hours after Deputy President William Ruto was heckled in Kisumu while in the company of the President in what appeared to be a tit for tat game.
