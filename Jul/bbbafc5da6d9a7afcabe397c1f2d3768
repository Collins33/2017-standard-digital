A Kenyan company has sued one of Asia&rsquo;s biggest sports betting firm for name infringement. Asian Betting and Gaming Enterprises Africa is accused of using the name &lsquo;Dafabet&rsquo; despite the same being registered locally by a different firm. Dafabet Kenya Limited accuses the Asian firm of using the name &lsquo;Dafabet&rsquo; to promote sports betting in the country. &ldquo;The defendant is involved in sports betting and gaming activities for gain and the defendant is currently unlawfully, illegally and wrongfully carrying out the same in Kenya under the plaintiff&rsquo;s name, Dafabet Kenya,&rdquo; court papers filed by lawyer Anthony Kiprono read in part.&nbsp; The Kenya firm claims that the use of the name &lsquo;Dafabet&rsquo; has caused confusion among its customers as it does not engage in betting. The company claims that its core business is indoor sports spaces designing. Lawyer Kiprono says sports betting enthusiasts have been making inquiries on games to bet on through the client&rsquo;s face book page and email accounts, and that this put the company at risk. &ldquo;Defendant&rsquo;s illegal use of the plaintiff&rsquo;s name Dafabet Kenya not only confuses the plaintiff&rsquo;s clients but exposes the plaintiff to third-party claims that may arise from the defendant&rsquo;s illegal acts,&rdquo; states the plaintiff in court papers. Dafabet Kenya wants the court to block the use of the company name locally. &nbsp;
