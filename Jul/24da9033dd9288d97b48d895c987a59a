The county government has constructed 70 rural health centres at a cost of Sh700 million, Chief Executive Officer for Health Ojwang Lusi has said. In addition, the government is planning to refurbish 26 other health facilities in the rural areas. &quot;We are also building new facilities to increase the proportion of the population living within 3-4km of a health centre in keeping with World Health Organization standards,&quot; said Dr Lusi, who is also the acting county secretary. This initiative, he said, would reduce the walking distance, especially in hard-to-reach areas in Nyakach, Seme, Nyando, Muhoroni, Kisumu East and West sub-counties. Most patients, especially in the rural areas, have been travelling long distances to access healthcare services and this has sometimes resulted in needless deaths. Lusi revealed that the construction of new health facilities was part of the county government&#39;s five-year (2013-2017) strategic health programme.

According to Lusi, health workers in cadres below Job Group P have been promoted. &quot;We are also processing promotions for those in Job Group P and above.&quot; The disclosure came as nurses continued to boycott work in protest over poor pay. They want their salaries increased before they can return to work. Operations in most public hospitals in the county remain paralysed as more than 500 nurses marched through the streets.
