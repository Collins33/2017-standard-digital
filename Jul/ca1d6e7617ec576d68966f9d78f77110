Brazil&rsquo;s former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has been sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison for graft in a stark fall from grace for the iconic leftist leader. Mr Lula, who ruled Brazil from 2003 to 2010, was convicted and handed a nine-and-a-half-year prison term on Wednesday for accepting a luxury seaside apartment and $1.1 million, the latest twist in a giant corruption probe engulfing Latin America&rsquo;s largest economy. But anti-corruption judge Sergio Moro said the 71-year-old would remain free pending an appeal - something his lawyers immediately said they would lodge. &ldquo;We are appealing and will prove his innocence,&rdquo; the lawyers said in a statement. The conviction nevertheless landed a heavy blow on the prospect of Lula making a political comeback in presidential elections due in October next year. The verdict also sent a dramatic message to much of Brazil&rsquo;s political class that they, too, risked falling afoul of the anti-graft drive.
