Kenyans have lost their buying power, spending even less on products despite the drop in the cost of living last month. According to 400 business procurement managers polled by Stanbic Bank, depressed demand has lowered business expectations, with anxiety over next month&rsquo;s elections making them to adopt a wait-and-see approach. The Purchasing Managers Index was down from 49.9 in May to 47.3 in June, below the crucial 50.0 threshold for the fourth time in the past five months, recording the second-lowest reading in the survey&rsquo;s history, which was indicative of a solid rate of contraction. &ldquo;Firms widely linked reduced output to a lower customer turnout reportedly due to the political climate,&rdquo; said Stanbic in the report.
