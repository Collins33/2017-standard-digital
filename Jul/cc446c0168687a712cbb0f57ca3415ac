Bernard Kiala has announced his withdrawal from the Machakos County gubernatorial raceKiala urged his supporters to rally behind the Opposition coalition led by Raila Odinga in the pollsMachakos Deputy Governor, Bernard Kiala has pulled out from the county gubernatorial race for the August 8 General Election. Kiala announced the surprise decision at a press conference held on Sunday in a Machakos hotel, where he said his action was motivated by the need to strengthen the National Super Alliance (NASA) in the forthcoming polls. &quot;Our withdrawal is for the sake of promoting a NASA win in the presidential race. Our withdrawal is unconditional. It is also in line with the need to rebuild Wiper (party) - honorable Stephen Musyoka&#39;s vehicle for his 2022 presidential bid,&quot; he said. Kiala, who was flanked by his running mate, Ms Evelyn Mutula, urged Machakos residents to turn out in large numbers and cast their votes in favour of the Opposition. &quot;Our plea to all 620,254 registered voters in Machakos is that no one should be left behind on August 8th. Let us vote for Raila Odinga and Kalonzo as president and running mate,&quot; he reiterated. Kiala&#39;s decision now leaves the Machakos gubernatorial contest between the incumbent, Alfred Mutua of Maendeleo Chap Chap, Wavinya Ndeti of Wiper and Jubilee&#39;s Lemi Muia. The current political scenario depicts a neck to neck contest between Mutua and Wavinya who have been in campaign frenzy for the past few days.
