A court was on Tuesday told queries had been raised over the importation of ethanol worth Sh7 million for which senior Government officials have been charged. Japheth Rono of Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) said the Kenya Revenue of Authority (KRA) was suspicious about the product in January 2016. Mr Rono, who has worked at KNBS since 2011, was testifying in a case in which a KRA officer and nine others have been charged with conspiracy to deny the Government revenue and importing a restricted commodity worth Sh7.3 million. Hillary Bett, Reuben Gachau, Mary Gathemia, Pius Kinyua and six others denied the charges and are out on Sh1 million bonds. The offence was allegedly committed at the Port of Mombasa in February 2016, when they allegedly tried to import 400 drums of ethanol.
