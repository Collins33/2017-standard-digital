NASA presidential candidate&nbsp;Raila Odinga has announced a campaign to mobilise youths to keep peace during elections. Raila&nbsp;said the countrywide campaign dubbed the &#39;White Hat Clarion&#39; will target youths, whom he said have a greater stake in the country&#39;s governance. He said the campaign will be rolled out today, the day famously known as Saba Saba, &quot;and will signal the onset of a people-led peaceful revolution to reclaim Kenya&#39;s lost glory&quot;. Saba Saba is an important day in Kenya&#39;s history as it heralded the quest for multi-party democracy in the 1990s. This culminated in the repeal of Section 2 (a) of the Constitution in 1991 to allow multi-party democracy in Kenya. The campaign will mark the beginning of the last phase of the NASA campaign and will see young people meet at Uhuru Park in Nairobi once a week to pray for peace. &quot;Commemoration of Saba Saba will take Kenyan youths on a liberation journey on August 8,&quot;&nbsp;Raila&nbsp;said. The election date is now being referred to as Nane Nane.
