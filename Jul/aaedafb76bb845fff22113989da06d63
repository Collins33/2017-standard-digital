Budalang&#39;i MP Ababu Namwamba denied National Super Alliance presidential candidate Raila Odinga&#39;s claim that he helped him to win the parliamentary seat two times. During a recent tour of Busia, Raila said he lifted Namwamba&#39;s hand to signal that he was the chosen Orange party candidate for the Budalang&#39;i parliamentary seat. Namwamba dared the NASA flagbearer to endorse the ODM candidate for the Budalang&#39;i constituency seat, Raphael Wanjala, and see if he will win the seat. &quot;I heard him (Raila) say he held my hand. Where? I&#39;m the one who campaigned rigorously,&quot; he said. He added that ODM was no longer as strong in Busia as it was when his Funyula counterpart, Paul Otuoma, and he were still in the party. Raila lifted Wanjala&#39;s hand at Siagonjo Stadium in Budalang&#39;i and urged constituents to vote for him. Raila said he had helped Namwamba to shine politically only for the MP to ditch ODM for the Jubilee Party.
