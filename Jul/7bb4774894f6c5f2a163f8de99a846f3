Jubilee candidates&nbsp;from Kisumu are seeking financial support&nbsp;from President Uhuru Kenyatta to help them continue with their campaigns ahead of&nbsp;the August elections. They said&nbsp;campaigning in an Opposition stronghold&nbsp;needed resources and complained&nbsp;that&nbsp;they have been left on their own despite their concerted&nbsp;efforts&nbsp;to get votes for the President in the August elections. The party&#39;s&nbsp;Kisumu Governor&#39;s aspirant, Mrs Christine Atieno Otieno, said a direct support from the party&#39;s top organ would give them a mileage in securing a win. The officials, however, raised fears that some people were masquerading as members of the Jubilee party in the region and asking for favours from the President yet they were supporting the Opposition. Atieno, who spoke to the Standard at the weekend after a meeting with her supporters&nbsp;at Kondele, strongly condemned a clique she said&nbsp;had been traveling to Nairobi to seek money from the party headquarters&nbsp;while masquerading as the party&#39;s&nbsp;candidates&nbsp;and campaigners. &nbsp; &quot;We are the genuine Aspirants from Nyanza, our posters are out there and we are working to ensure the President is reelected come August 8,&quot;said Atieno. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Uhuru&rsquo;s tough balancing act as he pursues Mt Kenya vote She said as Jubilee aspirants they have invited the President to tour the Nyanza region and rubbished claims that there were no jubilee supporters in that region. &nbsp; &quot;We have invited the President to come and we want to inform him that he has supporters in Nyanza. We are at the ground and we assure him that he has supporters,&quot; she reiterated.
