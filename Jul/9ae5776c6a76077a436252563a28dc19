Governor John Mruttu has asked the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and security agencies to investigate claims of vote buying in the area ahead of the August 8 elections. The governor claimed some people were going around the county collecting names and identity cards from voters. &quot;The unscrupulous people are also giving voters Sh50 and promising them more handouts as the elections approach,&quot; he said. But County Police Commander Fred Ochieng said police had not received any reports of vote buying.&nbsp;
