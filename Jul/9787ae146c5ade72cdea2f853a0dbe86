Local airline Safarilink has launched direct flights to Zanzibar. The service that began on Saturday will operate four times a week from Wilson Airport, including Monday, Thursday and Sunday. However, there are plans for daily flights by end of the year. The flights will depart from Wilson Airport at 2pm so as to allow passengers to connect from Masai Mara and Laikipia, while the early evening return flight from Zanzibar will enable connections to international flights. Safarilink will use its recently-acquired 52-seater Dash 8-315 aircraft on the new route, with an introductory fare of $390 (Sh40,000) for residents. Speaking in the Indian Ocean island after the inaugural flight, Safarilink Managing Director John Buckley said the development was the culmination of a project that was in the pipeline since mid 2015.
