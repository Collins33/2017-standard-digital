Shinyalu MP Silverse Lisamula was Saturday held for eight hours at Kakamega Central Police Station after he accused of disrupting a function that was being presided over by Public Services and Youth Affairs Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki. The CS was in Solia village Shinyalu constituency to launch a National Youth Service programme and issue cheques to locals. The ODM legislator was later freed after Kakamega Senator Dr Boni Khalwale stormed into the police station demanding for his release. He is required to report back to the police station on Monday. Shinyalu Officer Commanding Police Division Joseph Chebii said the politician is facing incitement charges and destruction of property. He said police have launched a manhunt for eight people suspected to be the lawmaker&rsquo;s supporters who disrupted the meeting. Lisamula accused Shinyalu Jubilee parliamentary candidate Babetuu Amutavi of being used by the ruling coalition to frustrate his efforts of defending his seat in the August polls. &ldquo;I know he has hatched a scheme to cause mayhem by ensuring my supporters and his clash at public functions so that my name is struck out of the Independent Elections and Boundaries Commission register,&rdquo; said Lisamula. Khalwale said they will not report back to the police station until the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinet writes a letter to the lawmaker detailing why he should appear at the police station.
