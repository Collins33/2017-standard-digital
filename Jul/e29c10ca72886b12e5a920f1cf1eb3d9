NAIVASHA, KENYA: The Kenya Export Floriculture, Horticulture and Allied Workers Union (KEFHAU) has expressed its concern over high job losses in the floriculture sector. The union has pointed out Karuturi flower farm where over 3,000 workers were laid off noting that one year down the workers are yet to be given their dues. This emerged when the union executive committee met for the first time in a Naivasha hotel after the Industrial court directed the registrar of trade unions to register the new body. Addressing the press, KEFHAU secretary-general David Omulama admitted that the sector faced various challenges but was quick to note that this could be addressed without industrial unrest. &quot;We are committed to addressing the plight of workers which include low payment, casualization of labor, long working hours and poor working conditions,&quot; he said. He said that none of the workers from Karuturi had received their benefits adding the farm could be reopened if there was goodwill from the government and the courts. &quot;It&rsquo;s emerging that the statutory deductions were not remitted meaning that the workers have lost nearly all their savings having worked for over 20 years,&quot; he said.
