&nbsp; Kenyans will soon be able to access national parks to prospect for minerals, a Principal Secretary has disclosed. Environment and Natural Resources Principal Secretary Margaret Mwakima said Attorney General Githu Muigai had already approved the mining regulations for gazettement by Mining Cabinet Secretary Dan Kazungu. Speaking at Maktau trading centre in Mwatate sub-county Thursday, the PS said Mr Kazungu would gazette the regulations that would pave the way for Kenyans to access national parks that are endowed with enormous mineral deposits. &quot;The wildlife ecosystem had been the preserve of a few powerful individuals. Indigenous people will now have the right to mine in the vast park, where the Mozambique gem belt passes through,&quot; said Dr Mwakima. She said the local community would benefit immensely from the Tsavo National Park - regarded as the largest wildlife ecosystem in the country.

Residents and leaders have complained constantly of massive exploitation of the local community by tycoons. Gemstone mining Available statistics show that about 70 per cent of gemstone mining in the country is carried out in the region, but residents have remained poor. Records from the Kenya Wildlife Service show that out of 21 large-scale miners licensed to mine in the park in the 1970s, only six were active. Among the influential miners who allegedly own mining claims in the vast Tsavo ecosystem are senior Government officials and legislators.&nbsp;
