A boda boda operator lured a form three student to his house and defiled her, a Kakamega court heard on Wednesday. According to police, school uniform and books were recovered from Michael Akhonya&#39;s house in Kakamega town. The court heard that Mr Akhonya told the minor to hide in her sister&#39;s room when his fellow boda boda operators notified him that police were on their way to his house. The man was arrested three months later when the girl was found to be pregnant.&nbsp;
