A Nyeri politician has invited NASA leader Raila Odinga to visit Nyeri County to campaign in what is traditionally a Jubilee stronghold. &nbsp; Charles Mwangi Ringui has asked Mr Odinga to visit Nyeri after he finishes his tour of Kiambu County. &nbsp; &quot;I would like the Opposition leader Mr Odinga to come to Nyeri and talk to voters, there are many people who would be willing to hear what he has to offer as President,&quot; he said. &nbsp; Ringui indicated that NASA leaders should hold a meeting with local residents even as he campaigns across the country. &nbsp; &quot;He has visited neighbouring counties but avoided Nyeri, and he should know he is welcome to come and campaign here just like any other candidate in the race,&quot; he added. &nbsp; While extending the invitation, Ringui said he would continue campaigning for the NASA leader because he was disappointed with the Jubilee government. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Jubilee leaders from Narok dismiss Raila Odinga &nbsp;
