Jubilee leaders have dismissed allegations by NASA presidential flag-bearer Raila Odinga accusing Deputy President William Ruto and Narok Governor Samuel Tunai of embezzling revenue collected from the world-famous Masai Mara Game Reserve. The politicians led by Governor Tunai, senators Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet), his Kericho counterpart Aaron Cheruiyot and MPs Kimani Inchungwa (Kikuyu) and Narok East&rsquo;s Lemanken Aramat termed Raila&rsquo;s claims as populist propaganda aimed at tarnishing their names. Speaking at Lesharu in Narok East, the leaders affirmed that no money has been lost, and that through the Kenya Airports Parking Services (KAPS) loopholes that used to create room for theft were sealed when devolution came to being. While speaking at Ng&rsquo;oswani in Narok West, Raila vowed to revoke the KAPS contract, saying despite the Masai Mara generating over Sh3 billion annually little was being felt by locals in terms of development. &ldquo;The Opposition has no agenda but is spreading propaganda and maligning people&rsquo;s names. Jubilee has done a lot in terms of reverting grabbed land from the Maasai community,&rdquo; Tunai said. The Jubilee leaders defended the Narok County Government on claims of misappropriation, saying the Opposition leader was lying to Kenyans. &ldquo;Raila should tell Kenyans why NASA campaigns are being funded by tax payers&rsquo; money. They want a NASA governor in Narok because they are salivating for revenue from the Mara,&rdquo; Murkomen said.
