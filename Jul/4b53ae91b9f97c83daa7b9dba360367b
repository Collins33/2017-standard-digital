Two people died in a road crash at Teachers near Salgaa Trading Centre on the Nakuru-Eldoret highway. Rongai OCPD Joseph Kioko said the weekend accident involved a trailer that was heading to Eldoret from Nairobi and a car. The dead were among the three people in the car that was travelling to Nakuru from Eldoret. The third person sustained minor injuries while the trailer&#39;s driver escaped unhurt, according to the police boss. The injured passenger was taken to Rift Valley Provincial General Hospital where he was treated and discharged. According to Kioko, the car was overtaking recklessly when it collided with the trailer head-on. He asked motorists to observe traffic rules and to avoid driving while drunk. He said there is increased traffic on the road as the August 8 election nears. ALSO READ: St Augustine Preparatory pupil crushed to death by school bus &nbsp;
