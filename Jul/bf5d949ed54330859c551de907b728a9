CIC Group Chief Executive Officer Tom Gitongo CIC Insurance Group&rsquo;s half-year net profit has risen 14 per cent from Sh330.7 million in June last year to Sh347.9 million this year. The Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed insurer&rsquo;s gross written premiums also grew from Sh6.3 billion to Sh7.6 billion during the period under review, representing a 21 per cent increase. Group Chief Executive Officer Tom Gitogo (right) while releasing the firm&rsquo;s results in Nairobi on Friday attributed the growth in profit to a strong performance in the medical cover business where gross written premiums grew by a whopping 71 per cent. Despite the growth in overall profit, he said, the insurer incurred an upsurge in claims, which went up by 28 per cent from Sh3.2 billion worth of claims in June last year to Sh4.1 billion this year. The insurer&rsquo;s operating expenses were also in an upward trajectory, rising by 20 per cent to Sh3 billion to Sh4.1 billion during the period under review. Mr Gitogo said a number of mitigating strategies were, however, put in place over the period.

The life cover segment also registered growth to contribute 53 per cent of the total gross written premiums. In an unexpected turn of events, the firm&rsquo;s subsidiary in conflict-hit South Sudan, where several Kenyan firms have closed shop, recorded a Sh20 million profit. &ldquo;This is because our asset management team there made investments in US dollars to combat the hyperinflation that weighed down the Sudanese pound,&rdquo; said Mr Gitogo.
