Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has declared he will vie for the country&#39;s top seat come 2022 General Election. Mutua has also spelt out an ambitious development plan he says that will see Machakos County transit from a third world to first world economy and urged residents to rally behind him. Speaking during the launch of his 2017-2022 manifesto at the Machakos University Hotel, the governor said all the pending development projects he initiated during his first term in office will also be completed in the next two years. Mutua, who is defending his seat on Maendeleo Chap Chap party has outlined infrastructure, agriculture, health care, Small Microenterprise development and education as key pillars of his development agenda and pleaded with voters to reelect him as governor in August polls. Among the ambitious plans Mutua has outlined in his manifesto include immediate implementation of the New Machakos City plan, whose development was contested in court by Senator Johnson Muthama in 2013. &quot;We are very excited because the High Court recently dismissed the case against the establishment of the new Machakos City, and soon we will be laying its foundation,&quot; said Dr Mutua. He said the New City Plan will be complimented by the proposed Machakos International Airport which will connect the county to the world. &quot;We have already held adequate consultations with the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority who have surveyed the proposed site and plans are in the pipeline to kick-start development of the facility,&quot; he said.
