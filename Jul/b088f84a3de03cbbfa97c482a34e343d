Wetang&#39;ula said he has information that the money, which was to be given to Nzoia about two months ago, was being dished out to voters in a bid to vote in favour of Jubilee in the August polls. He told the farmers not expect their payments soon but ensure they vote for NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga. He promised that NASA government will ensure farmers have been paid all their outstanding dues.

Where were they for the four years they have been in power?&quot; Wetang&#39;ula said. Wetang&#39;ula added that with proper management Nzoia sugar factory, sugarcane woes should be a thing of the past given the fact that the sugar miller has 40,000 acres. On the other hand, Bungoma governorship candidate Wycliffe Wangamati said once they take over power in the August polls, they will carry out a head count of all workers at the sugar miller in a bid to get rid of ghost workers. Wangamati said the company will only realise profits if they cut on costs. The factory closed down early this month due to lack of the raw material which the management attributed to the drought witnessed between December last year and March this year. Acting Managing Director Mike Kulundu said they expected to use the two months of closure to service the aging machines sbefore they resume milling at the end of August. Chairman of the company&#39;s board of directors Joash Wamangoli said said politicians should keep off the management of the company arguing that sugarcane shortage is being experienced everywhere in the country.
