The NASA presidential campaign team in Western region has asked the Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko and his IEBC counterpart Wafula Chebukati, to take stern action against cabinet secretaries and other civil servants for using state resources to campaign for the Jubilee Government. NASA presidential regional coordinator for Western Khalid Njiraini said the CSs and the civil servants were in gross violation of section 16 of Leadership and Integrity Act. Njiraini said CSs Eugene Wamalwa (Water), Amina Mohamed (Foreign Affairs), Mwangi Kiunjuri (Devolution), Principal Secretary Sammy Itemere (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) and other civil servants were campaigning for re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto using the public coffers money saying the DPP and IEBC must initiate punitive measures against them. &quot;The behavior of these civil servants confirms our fears that the August 8th elections will not be free and fair because they have now become part and parcel of the Jubilee campaign machinery and must be prosecuted by being fined Sh1 million or be imprisoned for up to 3years or both as per the law,&quot; said Njiraini. He also asked the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinet to see to it that the CSs and the other civil servants who are campaigning for the jubilee administration are reprimanded and taken to court arguing that if the mentioned persons will not be prosecuted, then NASA will go to court to have them removed from office. Njiraini also castigated IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati for not publishing the audited voters by KPMG in the local dailies.

Is Chebukati taking orders from the government of the day no to publish the names so that they can use the dead voters to rig elections in the August polls,&quot; he said. He further said IEBC was opposed to calls by NASA to cancel the ballot printing tender that was awarded to the Dubai based Al Ghurair company saying they were receiving instructions from the Government to continue with the ballot printing process so as to print extra ballot papers that will be used to rig elections. &nbsp;
