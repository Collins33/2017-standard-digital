Speaking today during a press conference at Panafric Hotel&nbsp;in Nairobi, NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka said they had evidence of an audacious plan by the Jubilee administration and&nbsp;top military commanders&nbsp;to use force to subvert next month&rsquo;s election with a rigged outcome. The document presented to the public by NASA indicated that very large numbers of officers and soldiers will be participating in the plot. It also stated that 226 new soldiers were being trained at Mariakani Barracks and were to be deployed on this mission.&nbsp; According to Raila the soldiers are being trained on how to cut off power and water in Kibera and Mathare slums and keep people out of city centre. President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto&nbsp;dismissed Raila&nbsp;claim on Jubilee&rsquo;s rigging plot saying it is a fabrication of a coalition afraid of losing in the August 8 election.
