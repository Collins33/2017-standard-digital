A man accused of killing Starehe Member of Parliament Maina Kamanda&#39;s supporter during nominations was charged on Sunday with murder. The accused, Daniel Kuria, also known as Dante, answered that he was not guilty of killing 28 year old George Ndege in a narrative that surrounds political violence. Mr Ndege died on April 24 this year in the process of placing Mr Kamanda&#39;s Jubilee party nomination campaign posters on buildings. An autopsy report by Dr Joseph Ndung&#39;u indicates that the deceased is alleged to have been assaulted by some unknown people and was knocked down by a minibus matatu while fleeing the attackers. The doctor&#39;s conclusion on the cause of death was due to multiple injuries on the head, chest and abdominal injuries due to blunt force trauma. &quot;The injuries were in keeping with those sustained in a motor vehicle accident,&quot; the doctor concluded.
