The Employment and Labour Relations Court has stopped the Nakuru County government from sacking 400 casual workers until a case they filed is determined. The court also ordered the county to pay the casuals all salary arrears dating back to April. The workers&rsquo; dismissal was to take effect from Friday, but they termed it unfair as they have worked for the county and the now-defunct municipality for the past five years. In a letter dated June 21 and signed by county Public Service Chief Officer Phillip Sigei, sub-county administrators were directed to fire any casual labourers working under them with effect from June 30. But Justice Nelson Abuodha said the circular was in violation of the workers&rsquo; constitutional rights and therefore not applicable. &ldquo;The petitioners have each worked continuously for the respondent for over five years and are therefore deemed permanent employees,&rdquo; said Abuodha. Abuodha ordered that the application be served on the county government and the case be mentioned before Justice Stephen Radido on July 13 in the Nakuru court.

However, the County Public Service Board recently embarked on recruiting 130 new enforcement officers who started their training on Monday.
