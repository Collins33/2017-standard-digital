Longhorn Publishers has unveiled a Kiswahili dictionary as it moves to fight off the effects of the recent one-pupil-one book policy. The publisher, which started a restructuring process that will see an unknown number of employees laid off, said on Tuesday it expected to increase its revenue by 20 per cent just from the sales of the Kamusi Kuu ya Kiswahili. Managing Director Simon Ngigi said the move was part of the firm&rsquo;s product and geographic diversification.
