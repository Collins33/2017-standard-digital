A new 480-kilometre Mombasa-Nairobi electricity line meant to deliver geothermal power to Mombasa has been completed. The 400 Kilovolt line, which is a Vision 2030 flagship project, was initiated in August 2011 and was scheduled for completion in three years but vandalism led to delays. James Mutemi of Kenya Electricity Transmission Company said the upgrade would boost power supply in the country. &quot;The line will enable electricity&nbsp;generated from the geothermal power plant at Olkaria to be transmitted to Mombasa,&quot; said Mr Mutemi.
