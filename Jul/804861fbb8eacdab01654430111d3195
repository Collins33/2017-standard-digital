Senator&nbsp;Gideon&nbsp;Moi has raised concerns over the resurgence of banditry even after the Government mounted a security operation to weed the criminals out. Suspected bandits killed four people on Wednesday in Lomeiywa, Mochongoi. More than 100 head of cattle were also stolen in the incident in which one of the bandits was shot by police reservists. Residents found the bodies of two victims who had gone missing in Lomeiywa Forest as they pursued the invaders. And speaking in Kabel yesterday,&nbsp;Gideon&nbsp;said more police officers should be deployed in the region to address runaway insecurity. He regretted that although there was a police operation was going on in the area, many residents were still being killed and maimed in attacks.

We fear that the attackers might continue with the killings if no efforts are made to deal with them,&rdquo; said the senator. He claimed the attackers were outsiders. &ldquo;These people must be taken back to where they came from because they are all outsiders. The Government must take decisive action so they can all be wiped out. They are armed and a danger to the society,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Security officers recently deployed by the Government are not enough to ensure security in areas prone to banditry.&rdquo; The senator regretted that in the latest attack, one of the victims was the sole breadwinner for his family.
