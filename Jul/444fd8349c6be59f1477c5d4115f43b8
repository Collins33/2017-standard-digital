&nbsp; Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama is in a legal tussle with his neighbours over a piece of land in Matungulu area. High Court Justice Oscar Angote recently cited one of the neighbours for contempt of court after he was found guilty of erecting a new fence on the disputed property. &ldquo;In the circumstances, and based on evidence before me, I find the first defendant (Nicholas Wambua) interfered with the boundaries of the suit land by erecting a barbed wire fence in disobedience of the orders of the court,&rdquo; the judge ruled on June 30. Muthama filed an application in 2014 seeking temporary orders stopping his neighbours Nicholas, Munyoki Wambua, Maithya Wambua, Ndunda Wambua, Kyengo Maithya, Charles Mutinda and Ancient Kioko from fencing, trespassing, selling, marketing or sub-dividing the suit property. The application was on grounds that there were consent orders on January 13, 2011, May 17, 2011 and February 21, 2012 that the parties maintain status quo over the property, pending hearing and determination of a case pending before the court.
