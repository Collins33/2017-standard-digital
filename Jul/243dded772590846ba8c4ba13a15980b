Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has ordered the closure of a primary school in Mukuru Kwa Reuben for fear of another cholera outbreak. Kidero directed the county health department to close down Tina&#39;s Education Centre, which has been a victim of poor waste disposal and management. He said the school was a public health risk as raw sewage flows into the small school compound, putting the lives of the children in danger. &quot;I was not aware of the school&#39;s existence, but after looking it up I found that it was registered by the Ministry of Education. Schools cannot operate in such an environment and, unfortunately, it will be closed,&quot; said Kidero. The school&#39;s troubles began last year when a developer decided to construct houses on a sewer line that empties the slum&#39;s effluent into a nearby river. The school is now flooded with sewage and even the classrooms and staff room are not spared. The school has a population of about 140 pupils. The county government has embarked on a campaign to close down more than 5,000 open-air eating places that are a health risk in the city. ALSO READ: Sonko pushes manifesto launch to July 23
