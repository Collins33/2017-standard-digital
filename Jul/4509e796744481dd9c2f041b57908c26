Youths in Kisumu County have vandalised Jubilee Party offices over claims that some party officials were buying national identity cards from voters. The youths broke window panes before torching furniture outside the rental house located in Kondele estate. The house is said to be owned by a Jubilee candidate in the county. The youths claimed they recovered 12 ID cards, four waiting cards and a passport, which they claimed the party officials had bought. A black book containing people&#39;s names, addresses and ID card numbers was also found. [Kevin Omolo]&nbsp; ALSO READ: Uhuru pleads with Nyeri and Murang&rsquo;a voters not to let him down
