Two Opposition leaders have accused the electoral agency of working with Jubilee to manipulate the voter register. ODM Secretary General Agnes Zani and his ANC counterpart Godfrey Osotsi yesterday sensationally claimed that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has deliberately interfered with voters register, to give Jubilee Party a head-start in the August polls. Zani who spoke at a press briefing at the party&#39;s headquarters in Nairobi, said figures of the registered voters released by the commission recently do not represent the true picture of the voters and their distribution in the country.
