Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu has announced closure of Jacaranda and San Valencia hotels over Cholera outbreak in Nairobi. He has ordered retesting of food handlers. Mailu said that many more hotels risk closure by the government after food handlers were ordered to acquire new certification within 21 days following increased cases of cholera outbreak within the country. However, the certificate will only be issued once the hotels staff and premises are tested and found to comply with set health standards. Kenyatta National Hospital had received about 70 patients by Tuesday evening, some in critical condition and overflowing from the isolation of wards.
