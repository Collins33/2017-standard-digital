Migori Governor Okoth Obado on Friday opened up six health facilities in Awendo and Rongo Sub- Counties in a bid to boost healthcare in the County. The facilities include surgical theaters and surgical wards in the both Sub County hospitals - Bonde, Ang&rsquo;ongo Dispensaries in Awendo and Kangeso Dispensary in Rongo. Speaking while officially opening the facilities, Obado said his government is committed to ensuring effective and affordable and accessible healthcare to the residents of Migori. &ldquo;No one should have to walk for more than five kilometers before reaching a health facility in this County and that is what we endeavor to achieve as a government,&rdquo; he said. In a bid to curb drugs theft that by hospital staff has caused perennial shortages in Government facilities in the County, the Governor has come up with a policy where every health facility has a chairman who keeps stock of all the drugs brought into the facilities. Last week, Obado moved to avert the nurses strike after he called nurses&rsquo; through their County Union to meet with the county government.
