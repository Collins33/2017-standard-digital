The controversial MP was released on Sh100, 000 cash bail. Lempurkel was apprehended by detectives and taken for questioning at Naromoru police station last Saturday. According to his personal assistant, they were on their way to Laikipia County when the MP was arrested in Nanyuki by Laikipia central DCIO. Laikipia County Commander Simon Kipkeu indicated that the MP incited members of the public to invade private ranches in Laikipia while attending a public rally in Moguarak. The rally was attended by NASA Presidential Candidate Rail Odinga. &quot;No one is above the law and there is no way the lawmaker can urge residents to invade private ranches in the area. The Constitution is very clear that every member of the public has the right to own land anywhere in the county,&quot; he said. The commander noted the lawmaker urged pastoral communities to graze in any land available for their livestock to survive.
