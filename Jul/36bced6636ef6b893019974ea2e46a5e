Kenya Railways has now moved to address concerns raised by the public on the mode of ticketing used on the Madaraka Express train passenger service. In a paid up advertisements appearing in a section of the press, Kenya Railways noted that to address the concern, they have embarked on working&nbsp;to introduce other modes of payments&nbsp;as a top priority which includes online ticketing. &#39;&#39;Mobile ticketing will also&nbsp;be considered&nbsp;as a component of&nbsp;the online module to address the situation,&#39;&#39; KR&nbsp;said in the statement. Last week, Kenya Tourism Federation (KTF), tourism umbrella body&nbsp;through its national chairman, Mr Mohamed Hersi&nbsp;criticised KR for its failure to introduce&nbsp;an online&nbsp; train booking system. Hersi wondered why&nbsp;passengers were still being required to&nbsp;present themselves physically at the stations&nbsp;to make the purchase for tickets.

In some instances, some unscrupulous parties have been taking advantage of the fairly available ticket prices by buying them in plenty and selling them at inflated prices to passengers. KR added that they are also in the process of revising&nbsp;the ticket format and will soon be rolling out&nbsp;a new version of the tickets incorporating passengers&rsquo; details. &#39;&#39;This will address the issue of unscrupulous purchase and resale of tickets at a premium,&#39;&#39; KR stated. KR explained that they have enhanced surveillance at the Terminus in Mombasa and Syokimau, Nairobi where the security team is on the ground to monitor any such occurrences and handle them appropriately. KR&nbsp;reiterated that tickets for Madaraka Express are only purchased at the Mombasa and Nairobi termini or through the Mpesa service. &#39;&#39;We therefore urge potential customers not to purchase any tickets from the unscrupulous parties&nbsp; outside our systems and outside our established&nbsp; prices in&nbsp; order to curb the irregular ticket menace,&#39;&#39; KR&nbsp; said.
