As farmers in Kirinyaga County start harvesting their maize crop, maize flour which has been missing in most outlets is now in abundance. Most of the outlets are no longer even restricting consumers to the number of packets of Unga they can purchase in one go. Leading supermarkets in the area have in stock all brands of Unga and the customers have a choice which to buy. &#39;&#39;I was surprised when I went to look for Unga in one of the supermarkets when I found all brands of the commodity are in abundance from the government controlled Sh90 to anything with no restrictions at the number of packets one wishes to buy,&#39;&#39; said Rosaline Njoki. On the other hand, farmers in the area have started to harvest their maize crop which has certainly reduced the over dependency on Unga from the shelves. A bumper harvest is underway as the season was favored by heavy rainfall unlike the previous season where farmers had nothing to put into their stores.
