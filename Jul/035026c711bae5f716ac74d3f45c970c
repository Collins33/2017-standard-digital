Governor Evans Kidero and Senator Mike Sonko could tie in votes if elections for Nairobi&nbsp;County&#39;s top job were held today, according to a new survey. The Trends and Insights for Africa (Tifa) poll indicates that both candidates are at par and now enjoy 44 per cent popularity with just 17 days to the August 8 elections. &quot;Sonko&#39;s popularity has gone up since the last poll and given that the margin of error is plus or minus 2 per cent, then there is no telling who between the two leaders would be governor if elections were held today,&quot; said Maggie Ireri, the Tifa director. Fighting chance Peter Kenneth, another candidate, is said to enjoy a four per cent preference followed by Miguna Miguna who has a one per cent fighting chance. Undecided Nairobians account for seven per cent.

Consequently, Sonko would win with 46 per cent popularity against Kidero&#39;s 45 per cent. However, 3 per cent of the electorate would still be up for grabs.&nbsp;
