More than 200,000 people will be employed under Kenya&#39;s first licensed special African Economic Zones (AEZ) to be launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta in Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County. Governor Jackson Mandago (pictured) said the President was expected to officiate the groundbreaking ceremony of the special economic zone on Friday. The AEZ Pearl River Industrial Park, expected to gobble up billions of shillings, will be set up in Plateau. The Government recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Chinese investors after an agreement was reached a month ago with Mr Mandago and businessman David Lagat, who travelled to China last October. &quot;The deal was reached with the top nine richest Chinese investors who agreed to develop industries in our county. This is the biggest development milestone we have secured since the inception of devolution,&quot; said Mandago. According to the governor, the deal signed by Chinese Guangdong New South Group Ltd is expected to attract more investors and make the region an economic hub. Tax rebates Mandago said as a county, those willing to invest would benefit from electricity, water, security and tax rebates. The project will see a huge number of people gain from job opportunities. Among some of the companies that are said to have already signed up to set up industries in the economic zone are organisations that will deal with transformers, electrical appliances and roofing sheets.
