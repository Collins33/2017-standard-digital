A 21-year-old man killed his sister on Friday at their home in Kanyamedha village, Kisumu County, under unclear circumstances. Police are hunting for the suspect who took to his heels immediately after slashing his sister, Betha Ougo, and killed her on the spot. The family said the two were alone at home at the time of the killing. Betha has left behind three young children, including twins who are just eight months old. The duo&rsquo;s elder brother, Vitalis Ndege, said the suspect had on a number of occasions attacked his sister over personal differences, but they did not anticipate that the fights would lead to killing. Ndege said the suspect had been threatening to stab one of the family members. &ldquo;Last week on Friday, the suspect tried to stab my sister with a knife but we wrestle dhim down and prevented any harm,&rdquo; said Ndege. But yesterday there was apparently no one to fight him off. No quarrel &ldquo;I was in school when I received a call from one of my cousins. When I came home, I found a crowd milling around our house and was given the shocking news that my brother had killed my sister,&rdquo; said a teary-eyed Ndege. Daniel Adongo, their cousin, who was with the deceased a few minutes before the incident said there was no quarrel before the attack. Kisumu West OCPD Wilston Mwakio said they are investigating the incident and hunting for the suspect. &ldquo;The suspect is still at large but we are doing everything to ensure he is brought to book,&rdquo; said Mwakio.
