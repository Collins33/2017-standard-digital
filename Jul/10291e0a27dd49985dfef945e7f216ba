Likoni is likely to experience violence during the August 8 elections, according to the electoral agency. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) official Julius Karimi termed the area as a violence hotspot. &quot;The area has been characterised by threats and gangs that have been instilling fear in residents,&quot; Karimi told a forum at the Likoni Social Hall. &quot;Elections are a few days away and we would like Kenyans to prepare for what might happen. People have severally been robbed in Likoni, which is a bad sign.&quot; Karimi called on locals to maintain peace during the elections and urged security agencies to increase patrols and deal with criminal gangs. The latest threat is circulation of leaflets by unknown people warning non-locals of dire consequences if they don&#39;t leave before the elections.
