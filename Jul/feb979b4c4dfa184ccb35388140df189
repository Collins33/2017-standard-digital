NASA co- principal Moses Wetang&#39;ula has cautioned the Luhya community against giving an ear to Deputy President William Ruto&#39;s lies that he will make Water CS Eugene Wamalwa his running mate in 2022. Wetang&#39;ula said this at a rally in Likuyani constituency on Monday while drumming up support for NASA where he said the DP is trying to hood wink the region to vote for Jubilee in the August polls by offering false promises to Eugene Wamalwa. &nbsp; The DP at a rally in Ndalu, asked the electorate from the region to vote for the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta so that come 2022 he will reward Water CS the running mate slot. Ruto said he will reciprocate by supporting Wamalwa for Presidency after completion of his two terms in 2032 saying he has brought leadership back to the region. Wetang&#39;ula noted the Deputy President will never be the President of Kenya since the NASA outfit will wrestle power from the Jubilee Government in the August arguing that in 2022, he himself will be the sixth President of Kenya. &quot;We will dethrone Jubilee Government from power in the August polls and both President Uhuru Kenyatta and the DP will be sent home. They have reached the peak of their political careers and they will never come back to active politics once Raila Odinga is declared fifth President,&quot; said Wetang&#39;ula ALSO READ: DP Ruto told to forget six piece suit voting in North Rift The Ford Kenya party leader also said Ruto orchestrated the fall of Eugene Wamalwa and he was trying to redeem himself by hood winking the electorate that he cares for them by picking their son as running mate. &nbsp;
