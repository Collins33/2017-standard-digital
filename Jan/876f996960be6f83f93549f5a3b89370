Police in Eldoret have arrested a teacher for allegedly defiling three girls in Chepkoilel. Residents, including village elder John Mwangi, yesterday stormed the suspect’s house after the minors disclosed that the man had repeatedly defiled them in a maize plantation. Mr Mwangi said although the man was not found in the act, the children aged between 12 and 16, had positively identified him after he was paraded before villagers who were baying for his blood. “We were shocked to learn from the children that the man had been waylaying them and defiling them separately on their way from school,” he said. He said the children revealed that the latest incident involved a 12-year-old Standard Five girl, who attended a school where the suspect taught. Mwangi said the man was hired by parents as a volunteer, and he has been teaching social studies, mathematics, Kiswahili and religious studies. Villagers frog-marched the man from his house, with his hands, tied together. Some of them vented their frustration by caning him. Police who were called picked the man and the three girls. The suspect reportedly admitted having an affair with a 16-year-old Form Two girl and two other minors. “It is true I have been having an affair with these girls. I have slept with all of them in different locations and they know each other since last year. "I used to waylay them as they returned from school and lure them into maize plantations. I even promised to marry the one in Form Two after she completed her fourth form,” he said, and blamed the devil for his actions. Area assistant chief Christine Cheboi confirmed the arrest. “I alerted the police who accompanied me to the scene. In fact the man admitted that he has been sleeping with minors in the village after I interrogated him. "Police have arrested and locked him up at Moiben Police Station. We have taken the minors to hospital for tests and launched investigations into the matter,” she said.
